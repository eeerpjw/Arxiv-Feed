> ABSTRACT  :  A main challenge faced in the deep learning-based Underwater Image **Enhancement** (UIE) is that the ground truth high-quality image is unavailable. Most of the existing methods first generate approximate reference maps and then train an **enhancement** network with certainty. This kind of method fails to handle the ambiguity of the reference map. In this paper, we resolve UIE into distribution estimation and consensus process. We present a novel probabilistic network to learn the **enhancement** distribution of degraded underwater images. Specifically, we combine conditional variational autoencoder with adaptive instance normalization to construct the **enhancement** distribution. After that, we adopt a consensus process to predict a deterministic result based on a set of samples from the distribution. By learning the **enhancement** distribution, our method can cope with the bias introduced in the reference map labeling to some extent. Additionally, the consensus process is useful to capture a robust and stable result. We examined the proposed method on two widely used real-world underwater image **enhancement** datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables sampling possible **enhancement** predictions. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate yields competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art UIE methods. Code available at https://github.com/zhenqifu/PUIE-Net.

> ABSTRACT  :  Blind face **restoration** usually encounters with diverse scale face inputs, especially in the real world. However, most of the current works support specific scale faces, which limits its application ability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel scale-aware blind face **restoration** framework, named FaceFormer, which formulates facial feature **restoration** as scale-aware transformation. The proposed Facial Feature Up-sampling (FFUP) module dynamically generates upsampling filters based on the original scale-factor priors, which facilitate our network to adapt to arbitrary face scales. Moreover, we further propose the facial feature embedding (FFE) module which leverages transformer to hierarchically extract diversity and robustness of facial latent. Thus, our FaceFormer achieves fidelity and robustness restored faces, which possess realistic and symmetrical details of facial components. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method trained with synthetic dataset generalizes better to a natural low quality images than current state-of-the-arts.  
### NeuralBF: Neural **Bilateral** Filtering for Top-down Instance Segmentation on Point Clouds. (arXiv:2207.09978v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  We introduce a method for instance proposal generation for 3D point clouds. Existing techniques typically directly regress proposals in a single feed-forward step, leading to inaccurate estimation. We show that this serves as a critical bottleneck, and propose a method based on iterative **bilateral** filtering with learned kernels. Following the spirit of **bilateral** filtering, we consider both the deep feature embeddings of each point, as well as their locations in the 3D space. We show via synthetic experiments that our method brings drastic improvements when generating instance proposals for a given point of interest. We further validate our method on the challenging ScanNet benchmark, achieving the best instance segmentation performance amongst the sub-category of top-down methods.  
### Locality Guidance for Improving Vision Transformers on Tiny Datasets. (arXiv:2207.10026v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  While the Vision Transformer (VT) architecture is becoming trendy in computer vision, pure VT models perform poorly on tiny datasets. To address this issue, this paper proposes the locality guidance for improving the performance of VTs on tiny datasets. We first analyze that the local information, which is of great importance for understanding images, is hard to be learned with limited data due to the high flexibility and intrinsic globality of the self-attention mechanism in VTs. To facilitate local information, we realize the locality guidance for VTs by imitating the features of an already trained convolutional neural network (CNN), inspired by the built-in local-to-global hierarchy of CNN. Under our dual-task learning paradigm, the locality guidance provided by a lightweight CNN trained on low-resolution images is adequate to accelerate the convergence and improve the performance of VTs to a large extent. Therefore, our locality guidance approach is very simple and efficient, and can serve as a basic performance **enhancement** method for VTs on tiny datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve VTs when training from scratch on tiny datasets and is compatible with different kinds of VTs and datasets. For example, our proposed method can boost the performance of various VTs on tiny datasets (e.g., 13.07% for DeiT, 8.98% for T2T and 7.85% for PVT), and enhance even stronger baseline PVTv2 by 1.86% to 79.30%, showing the potential of VTs on tiny datasets.

### Single Frame Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigation: A Benchmark Study and A New Physics-Inspired Transformer Model. (arXiv:2207.10040v1 [eess.IV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Image **restoration** algorithms for atmospheric turbulence are known to be much more challenging to design than traditional ones such as blur or noise because the distortion caused by the turbulence is an entanglement of spatially varying blur, geometric distortion, and sensor noise. Existing CNN-based **restoration** methods built upon convolutional kernels with static weights are insufficient to handle the spatially dynamical atmospheric turbulence effect. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a physics-inspired transformer model for imaging through atmospheric turbulence. The proposed network utilizes the power of transformer blocks to jointly extract a dynamical turbulence distortion map and restore a turbulence-free image. In addition, recognizing the lack of a comprehensive dataset, we collect and present two new real-world turbulence datasets that allow for evaluation with both classical objective metrics (e.g., PSNR and SSIM) and a new task-driven metric using text recognition accuracy. Both real testing sets and all related code will be made publicly available.  
### Learning Discriminative Shrinkage Deep Networks for Image Deconvolution. (arXiv:2111.13876v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Most existing methods usually formulate the non-blind deconvolution problem into a maximum-a-posteriori framework and address it by manually designing kinds of regularization terms and data terms of the latent clear images. However, explicitly designing these two terms is quite challenging and usually leads to complex optimization problems which are difficult to solve. In this paper, we propose an effective non-blind deconvolution approach by learning discriminative shrinkage functions to implicitly model these terms. In contrast to most existing methods that use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or radial basis functions to simply learn the regularization term, we formulate both the data term and regularization term and split the deconvolution model into data-related and regularization-related sub-problems according to the alternating direction method of multipliers. We explore the properties of the Maxout function and develop a deep CNN model with a Maxout layer to learn discriminative shrinkage functions to directly approximate the solutions of these two sub-problems. Moreover, given the fast-Fourier-transform-based image **restoration** usually leads to ringing artifacts while conjugate-gradient-based approach is time-consuming, we develop the Conjugate Gradient Network to restore the latent clear images effectively and efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art ones in terms of efficiency and accuracy.  
### Bringing Rolling Shutter Images Alive with Dual Reversed Distortion. (arXiv:2203.06451v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Rolling shutter (RS) distortion can be interpreted as the result of picking a row of pixels from instant global shutter (GS) frames over time during the **exposure** of the RS camera. This means that the information of each instant GS frame is partially, yet sequentially, embedded into the row-dependent distortion. Inspired by this fact, we address the challenging task of reversing this process, i.e., extracting undistorted GS frames from images suffering from RS distortion. However, since RS distortion is coupled with other factors such as readout settings and the relative velocity of scene elements to the camera, models that only exploit the geometric correlation between temporally adjacent images suffer from poor generality in processing data with different readout settings and dynamic scenes with both camera motion and object motion. In this paper, instead of two consecutive frames, we propose to exploit a pair of images captured by dual RS cameras with reversed RS directions for this highly challenging task. Grounded on the symmetric and complementary nature of dual reversed distortion, we develop a novel end-to-end model, IFED, to generate dual optical flow sequence through iterative learning of the velocity field during the RS time. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IFED is superior to naive cascade schemes, as well as the state-of-the-art which utilizes adjacent RS images. Most importantly, although it is trained on a synthetic dataset, IFED is shown to be effective at retrieving GS frame sequences from real-world RS distorted images of dynamic scenes.

### Towards Learning Neural Representations from Shadows. (arXiv:2203.15946v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  We present a method that learns neural shadow fields which are neural scene representations that are only learnt from the shadows present in the scene. While traditional shape-from-shadow (SfS) algorithms reconstruct geometry from shadows, they assume a fixed scanning setup and fail to generalize to complex scenes. Neural rendering algorithms, on the other hand, rely on photometric consistency between RGB images, but largely ignore physical cues such as shadows, which have been shown to provide valuable information about the scene. We observe that shadows are a powerful cue that can constrain neural scene representations to learn SfS, and even outperform **NeRF** to reconstruct otherwise hidden geometry. We propose a graphics-inspired differentiable approach to render accurate shadows with volumetric rendering, predicting a shadow map that can be compared to the ground truth shadow. Even with just binary shadow maps, we show that neural rendering can localize the object and estimate coarse geometry. Our approach reveals that sparse cues in images can be used to estimate geometry using differentiable volumetric rendering. Moreover, our framework is highly generalizable and can work alongside existing 3D reconstruction techniques that otherwise only use photometric consistency.  
### DFNet: Enhance Absolute Pose Regression with Direct Feature Matching. (arXiv:2204.00559v4 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  We introduce a camera relocalization pipeline that combines absolute pose regression (APR) and direct feature matching. By incorporating **exposure**-adaptive novel view synthesis, our method successfully addresses photometric distortions in outdoor environments that existing photometric-based methods fail to handle. With domain-invariant feature matching, our solution improves pose regression accuracy using semi-supervised learning on unlabeled data. In particular, the pipeline consists of two components: Novel View Synthesizer and DFNet. The former synthesizes novel views compensating for changes in **exposure** and the latter regresses camera poses and extracts robust features that close the domain gap between real images and synthetic ones. Furthermore, we introduce an online synthetic data generation scheme. We show that these approaches effectively enhance camera pose estimation both in indoor and outdoor scenes. Hence, our method achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy by outperforming existing single-image APR methods by as much as 56%, comparable to 3D structure-based methods.

> ABSTRACT  :  This paper proposes a novel pixel interval down-sampling network (PID-Net) for dense tiny object (yeast cells) counting tasks with higher accuracy. The PID-Net is an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) model with an encoder--decoder architecture. The pixel interval down-sampling operations are concatenated with max-pooling operations to combine the sparse and dense features. This addresses the limitation of contour conglutination of dense objects while counting. The evaluation was conducted using classical segmentation metrics (the Dice, Jaccard and Hausdorff distance) as well as counting metrics. The experimental results show that the proposed PID-Net had the best performance and potential for dense tiny object counting tasks, which achieved 96.97\% counting accuracy on the dataset with 2448 yeast cell images. By comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches, such as Attention U-Net, **Swin** U-Net and Trans U-Net, the proposed PID-Net can segment dense tiny objects with clearer boundaries and fewer incorrect debris, which shows the great potential of PID-Net in the task of accurate counting.  
### Simple Baselines for Image **Restoration**. (arXiv:2204.04676v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Although there have been significant advances in the field of image **restoration** recently, the system complexity of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods is increasing as well, which may hinder the convenient analysis and comparison of methods. In this paper, we propose a simple baseline that exceeds the SOTA methods and is computationally efficient. To further simplify the baseline, we reveal that the nonlinear activation functions, e.g. Sigmoid, ReLU, GELU, Softmax, etc. are not necessary: they could be replaced by multiplication or removed. Thus, we derive a Nonlinear Activation Free Network, namely NAFNet, from the baseline. SOTA results are achieved on various challenging benchmarks, e.g. 33.69 dB PSNR on GoPro (for image deblurring), exceeding the previous SOTA 0.38 dB with only 8.4% of its computational costs; 40.30 dB PSNR on SIDD (for image denoising), exceeding the previous SOTA 0.28 dB with less than half of its computational costs. The code and the pre-trained models are released at https://github.com/megvii-research/NAFNet.

### ESPnet-SE++: Speech **Enhancement** for Robust Speech Recognition, Translation, and Understanding. (arXiv:2207.09514v1 [eess.AS])

> ABSTRACT  :  This paper presents recent progress on integrating speech separation and **enhancement** (SSE) into the ESPnet toolkit. Compared with the previous ESPnet-SE work, numerous features have been added, including recent state-of-the-art speech **enhancement** models with their respective training and evaluation recipes. Importantly, a new interface has been designed to flexibly combine speech **enhancement** front-ends with other tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST), and spoken language understanding (SLU). To showcase such integration, we performed experiments on carefully designed synthetic datasets for noisy-reverberant multi-channel ST and SLU tasks, which can be used as benchmark corpora for future research. In addition to these new tasks, we also use CHiME-4 and WSJ0-2Mix to benchmark multi- and single-channel SE approaches. Results show that the integration of SE front-ends with back-end tasks is a promising research direction even for tasks besides ASR, especially in the multi-channel scenario. The code is available online at https://github.com/ESPnet/ESPnet. The multi-channel ST and SLU datasets, which are another contribution of this work, are released on HuggingFace.  
### Speech **Enhancement** Guided by Contextual Articulatory Information. (arXiv:2011.07442v3 [cs.SD] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07442](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07442)
> ABSTRACT  :  Previous studies have confirmed that by augmenting acoustic features with the place/manner of articulatory features, the speech **enhancement** (SE) process can be guided to consider the articulatory properties of the input speech when performing **enhancement** to attain performance improvements. Thus, the contextual information of articulatory attributes has additional information that can further benefit SE. This study proposed an SE system that improved performance by optimizing contextual articulatory information in enhanced speech through joint training of the SE model with an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) model and predicting the sequence of broad phone classes (BPCs) instead of the phoneme/word sequences. We developed two strategies to train the SE system based on BPC-based ASR: multi-task learning and deep-feature training strategies. Experimental results from speech denoising, speech dereverberation, and impaired speech **enhancement** tasks confirmed that the contextual articulatory information facilitates the SE system to improve **enhancement** results. Moreover, in contrast to another SE system trained with monophonic ASR, the BPC-based ASR (providing contextual articulatory information) can achieve superior SE performance at different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels.
