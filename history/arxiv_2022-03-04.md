> ABSTRACT  :  Predictive uncertainty estimation is essential for deploying Deep Neural Networks in real-world autonomous systems. However, disentangling the different types and sources of uncertainty is non trivial in most datasets, especially since there is no ground truth for uncertainty. In addition, different degrees of weather conditions can disrupt neural networks, resulting in inconsistent training data quality. Thus, we introduce the MUAD dataset (Multiple Uncertainties for Autonomous Driving), consisting of 8,500 realistic synthetic images with diverse adverse weather conditions (**night**, fog, rain, snow), out-of-distribution objects and annotations for semantic segmentation, depth estimation, object and instance detection. MUAD allows to better assess the impact of different sources of uncertainty on model performance. We propose a study that shows the importance of having reliable Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in multiple experiments, and will release our dataset to allow researchers to benchmark their algorithm methodically in ad-verse conditions. More information and the download link for MUAD are available at https://muad-dataset.github.io/ .  
### Selective Residual M-Net for Real Image Denoising. (arXiv:2203.01645v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors : Mao Fan, Jung Liu, Hsien Liu
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01645](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01645)
> ABSTRACT  :  Image **restoration** is a low-level vision task which is to restore degraded images to noise-free images. With the success of deep neural networks, the convolutional neural networks surpass the traditional **restoration** methods and become the mainstream in the computer vision area. To advance the performanceof denoising algorithms, we propose a blind real image denoising network (SRMNet) by employing a hierarchical architecture improved from U-Net. Specifically, we use a selective kernel with residual block on the hierarchical structure called M-Net to enrich the multi-scale semantic information. Furthermore, our SRMNet has competitive performance results on two synthetic and two real-world noisy datasets in terms of quantitative metrics and visual quality. The source code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/TentativeGitHub/SRMNet.  
### Vision-Language Intelligence: Tasks, Representation Learning, and Large Models. (arXiv:2203.01922v1 [cs.CV])

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01922](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01922)
> ABSTRACT  :  This paper presents a comprehensive survey of vision-language (VL) intelligence from the perspective of time. This survey is inspired by the remarkable progress in both computer vision and natural language processing, and recent trends shifting from single modality processing to multiple modality comprehension. We summarize the development in this field into three time periods, namely task-specific methods, vision-language pre-training (VLP) methods, and larger models empowered by large-scale weakly-labeled data. We first take some common VL tasks as examples to introduce the development of task-specific methods. Then we focus on VLP methods and comprehensively review key components of the model structures and training methods. After that, we show how recent work utilizes large-scale raw image-text data to learn language-aligned visual representations that generalize better on zero or few shot learning tasks. Finally, we discuss some potential future trends towards modality cooperation, unified representation, and knowledge incorporation. We believe that this review will be of help for researchers and practitioners of AI and ML, especially those interested in computer vision and natural language processing.  
### iSegFormer: Interactive Segmentation via Transformers with Application to 3D Knee MR Images. (arXiv:2112.11325v4 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Qin Liu, Zhenlin Xu, Yining Jiao, Marc Niethammer
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11325](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11325)
> ABSTRACT  :  We propose iSegFormer, a memory-efficient transformer that combines a **Swin** transformer with a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) decoder. With the efficient **Swin** transformer blocks for hierarchical self-attention and the simple MLP decoder for aggregating both local and global attention, iSegFormer learns powerful representations while achieving high computational efficiencies. Specifically, we apply iSegFormer to interactive 3D medical image segmentation.

### A 915-1220 TOPS/W Hybrid In-Memory Computing based Image **Restoration** and Region Proposal Integrated Circuit for Neuromorphic Vision Sensors in 65nm CMOS. (arXiv:2203.01413v1 [cs.AR])
- Authors : Xueyong Zhang, Arindam Basu
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01413](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01413)
> ABSTRACT  :  In this work, we present a hybrid memory bit cell - collocated SRAM and DRAM (CRAM) consisting of 11 transistors for in-memory computing (IMC) based image **restoration** (IR) and region proposal (RP). A robust RP updated algorithm is proposed to improve the performance. This work demonstrates IMC based global parallel diffusion and column/row-wise projection to achieve a maximal energy efficiency of 1220 TOPS/W for image **restoration** and 915 TOPS/W when combined with region proposal.

### Machine learning based lens-free imaging technique for field-portable cytometry. (arXiv:2203.00899v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Rajkumar Vaghashiya, Sanghoon Shin, Varun Chauhan, Kaushal Kapadiya, Smit Sanghavi, Sungkyu Seo, Mohendra Roy
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00899](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00899)
> ABSTRACT  :  Lens-free Shadow Imaging Technique (LSIT) is a well-established technique for the characterization of microparticles and biological cells. Due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, various low-cost solutions have been evolved, such as automatic analysis of complete blood count (CBC), cell viability, 2D cell morphology, 3D cell tomography, etc. The developed auto characterization algorithm so far for this custom-developed LSIT cytometer was based on the hand-crafted features of the cell diffraction patterns from the LSIT cytometer, that were determined from our empirical findings on thousands of samples of individual cell types, which limit the system in terms of induction of a new cell type for auto classification or characterization. Further, its performance is suffering from poor image (cell diffraction pattern) signatures due to its small signal or background noise. In this work, we address these issues by leveraging the artificial intelligence-powered auto signal enhancing scheme such as denoising autoencoder and adaptive cell characterization technique based on the transfer of learning in deep neural networks. The performance of our proposed method shows an increase in accuracy &gt;98% along with the signal **enhancement** of &gt;5 dB for most of the cell types, such as Red Blood Cell (RBC) and White Blood Cell (WBC). Furthermore, the model is adaptive to learn new type of samples within a few learning iterations and able to successfully classify the newly introduced sample along with the existing other sample types.

### Privacy-Aware Crowd Labelling for Machine Learning Tasks. (arXiv:2203.01373v1 [cs.HC])
- Authors : Giannis Haralabopoulos, Ioannis Anagnostopoulos
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01373](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01373)
> ABSTRACT  :  The extensive use of online social media has highlighted the importance of privacy in the digital space. As more scientists analyse the data created in these platforms, privacy concerns have extended to data usage within the academia. Although text analysis is a well documented topic in academic literature with a multitude of applications, ensuring privacy of user-generated content has been overlooked. Most sentiment analysis methods require emotion labels, which can be obtained through crowdsourcing, where non-expert individuals contribute to scientific tasks. The text itself has to be exposed to third parties in order to be labelled. In an effort to reduce the **exposure** of online users' information, we propose a privacy preserving text labelling method for varying applications, based in crowdsourcing. We transform text with different levels of privacy, and analyse the effectiveness of the transformation with regards to label correlation and consistency. Our results suggest that privacy can be implemented in labelling, retaining the annotational diversity and subjectivity of traditional labelling.
