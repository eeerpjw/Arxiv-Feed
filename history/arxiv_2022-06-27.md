> ABSTRACT  :  Neural Radiance Fields (**NeRF**s) increase reconstruction detail for novel view synthesis and scene reconstruction, with applications ranging from large static scenes to dynamic human motion. However, the increased resolution and model-free nature of such neural fields come at the cost of high training times and excessive memory requirements. Recent advances improve the inference time by using complementary data structures yet these methods are ill-suited for dynamic scenes and often increase memory consumption. Little has been done to reduce the resources required at training time. We propose a method to exploit the redundancy of **NeRF**'s sample-based computations by partially sharing evaluations across neighboring sample points. Our U**NeRF** architecture is inspired by the UNet, where spatial resolution is reduced in the middle of the network and information is shared between adjacent samples. Although this change violates the strict and conscious separation of view-dependent appearance and view-independent density estimation in the **NeRF** method, we show that it improves novel view synthesis. We also introduce an alternative subsampling strategy which shares computation while minimizing any violation of view invariance. U**NeRF** is a plug-in module for the original **NeRF** network. Our major contributions include reduction of the memory footprint, improved accuracy, and reduced amortized processing time both during training and inference. With only weak assumptions on locality, we achieve improved resource utilization on a variety of neural radiance fields tasks. We demonstrate applications to the novel view synthesis of static scenes as well as dynamic human shape and motion.

> ABSTRACT  :  In recent years, the Thermal Image Super-Resolution (TISR) problem has become an attractive research topic. TISR would been used in a wide range of fields, including military, medical, agricultural and animal ecology. Due to the success of PBVS-2020 and PBVS-2021 workshop challenge, the result of TISR keeps improving and attracts more researchers to sign up for PBVS-2022 challenge. In this paper, we will introduce the technical details of our submission to PBVS-2022 challenge designing a **Bilateral** Network with Channel Splitting Network and Transformer(BN-CSNT) to tackle the TISR problem. Firstly, we designed a context branch based on channel splitting network with transformer to obtain sufficient context information. Secondly, we designed a spatial branch with shallow transformer to extract low level features which can preserve the spatial information. Finally, for the context branch in order to fuse the features from channel splitting network and transformer, we proposed an attention refinement module, and then features from context branch and spatial branch are fused by proposed feature fusion module. The proposed method can achieve PSNR=33.64, SSIM=0.9263 for x4 and PSNR=21.08, SSIM=0.7803 for x2 in the PBVS-2022 challenge test dataset.  
### A novel approach for glaucoma classification by wavelet neural networks using graph-based, statisitcal features of qualitatively improved images. (arXiv:2206.12099v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we have proposed a new glaucoma classification approach that employs a wavelet neural network (WNN) on optimally enhanced retinal images features. To avoid tedious and error prone manual analysis of retinal images by ophthalmologists, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) substantially aids in robust diagnosis. Our objective is to introduce a CAD system with a fresh approach. Retinal image quality improvement is attempted in two phases. The retinal image preprocessing phase improves the brightness and contrast of the image through quantile based histogram modification. It is followed by the image **enhancement** phase, which involves multi scale morphological operations using image specific dynamic structuring elements for the retinal structure enrichment. Graph based retinal image features in terms of Local Graph Structures (LGS) and Graph Shortest Path (GSP) statistics are extracted from various directions along with the statistical features from the enhanced retinal dataset. WNN is employed to classify glaucoma retinal images with a suitable wavelet activation function. The performance of the WNN classifier is compared with multilayer perceptron neural networks with various datasets. The results show our approach is superior to the existing approaches.  
### Enhancing Quality of Pose-varied Face **Restoration** with Local Weak Feature Sensing and GAN Prior. (arXiv:2205.14377v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Facial semantic guidance (including facial landmarks, facial heatmaps, and facial parsing maps) and facial generative adversarial networks (GAN) prior have been widely used in blind face **restoration** (BFR) in recent years. Although existing BFR methods have achieved good performance in ordinary cases, these solutions have limited resilience when applied to face images with serious degradation and pose-varied (e.g., looking right, looking left, laughing, etc.) in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a well-designed blind face **restoration** network with generative facial prior. The proposed network is mainly comprised of an asymmetric codec and a StyleGAN2 prior network. In the asymmetric codec, we adopt a mixed multi-path residual block (MMRB) to gradually extract weak texture features of input images, which can better preserve the original facial features and avoid excessive fantasy. The MMRB can also be plug-and-play in other networks. Furthermore, thanks to the affluent and diverse facial priors of the StyleGAN2 model, we adopt a fine-tuned approach to flexibly restore natural and realistic facial details. Besides, a novel self-supervised training strategy is specially designed for face **restoration** tasks to fit the distribution closer to the target and maintain training stability. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance to the prior art for face **restoration** and face super-resolution tasks.  
### Short-range forecasts of global precipitation using deep learning-augmented numerical weather prediction. (arXiv:2206.11669v2 [physics.ao-ph] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Precipitation governs Earth's hydroclimate, and its daily spatiotemporal fluctuations have major socioeconomic effects. Advances in Numerical weather prediction (NWP) have been measured by the improvement of forecasts for various physical fields such as temperature and pressure; however, large biases exist in precipitation prediction. We augment the output of the well-known NWP model CFSv2 with deep learning to create a hybrid model that improves short-range global precipitation at 1-, 2-, and 3-day lead times. To hybridise, we address the sphericity of the global data by using modified DLWP-CS architecture which transforms all the fields to cubed-sphere projection. Dynamical model precipitation and surface temperature outputs are fed into a modified DLWP-CS (UNET) to forecast ground truth precipitation. While CFSv2's average bias is +5 to +7 mm/day over land, the multivariate deep learning model decreases it to within -1 to +1 mm/day. Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Hurricane Ivan in 2004, China floods in 2010, India floods in 2005, and Myanmar storm Nargis in 2008 are used to confirm the substantial **enhancement** in the skill for the hybrid dynamical-deep learning model. CFSv2 typically shows a moderate to large bias in the spatial pattern and overestimates the precipitation at short-range time scales. The proposed deep learning augmented NWP model can address these biases and vastly improve the spatial pattern and magnitude of predicted precipitation. Deep learning enhanced CFSv2 reduces mean bias by 8x over important land regions for 1 day lead compared to CFSv2. The spatio-temporal deep learning system opens pathways to further the precision and accuracy in global short-range precipitation forecasts.
