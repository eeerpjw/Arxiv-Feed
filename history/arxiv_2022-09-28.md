> ABSTRACT  :  A spatial AI that can perform complex tasks through visual signals and cooperate with humans is highly anticipated. To achieve this, we need a visual SLAM that easily adapts to new scenes without pre-training and generates dense maps for downstream tasks in real-time. None of the previous learning-based and non-learning-based visual SLAMs satisfy all needs due to the intrinsic limitations of their components. In this work, we develop a visual SLAM named Orbeez-SLAM, which successfully collaborates with implicit neural representation (NeRF) and visual odometry to achieve our goals. Moreover, Orbeez-SLAM can work with the monocular camera since it only needs RGB inputs, making it widely applicable to the real world. We validate its effectiveness on various challenging benchmarks. Results show that our SLAM is up to 800x faster than the strong baseline with superior rendering outcomes.

> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we propose an algorithm to interpolate between a pair of images of a dynamic scene. While in the past years significant progress in frame interpolation has been made, current approaches are not able to handle images with brightness and illumination changes, which are common even when the images are captured shortly apart. We propose to address this problem by taking advantage of the existing optical flow methods that are highly robust to the variations in the illumination. Specifically, using the bidirectional flows estimated using an existing pre-trained flow network, we predict the flows from an intermediate frame to the two input images. To do this, we propose to encode the bidirectional flows into a coordinate-based network, powered by a hypernetwork, to obtain a continuous representation of the flow across time. Once we obtain the estimated flows, we use them within an existing blending network to obtain the final intermediate frame. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is able to produce significantly better results than state-of-the-art frame interpolation algorithms.

> ABSTRACT  :  Provident detection of other road users at **night** has the potential for increasing road safety. For this purpose, humans intuitively use visual cues, such as light cones and light reflections emitted by other road users to be able to react to oncoming traffic at an early stage. This behavior can be imitated by computer vision methods by predicting the appearance of vehicles based on emitted light reflections caused by the vehicle's headlights. Since current object detection algorithms are mainly based on detecting directly visible objects annotated via bounding boxes, the detection and annotation of light reflections without sharp boundaries is challenging. For this reason, the extensive open-source dataset PVDN (Provident Vehicle Detection at **Night**) was published, which includes traffic scenarios at **night** with light reflections annotated via keypoints. In this paper, we explore the potential of saliency-based approaches to create different object representations based on the visual saliency and sparse keypoint annotations of the PVDN dataset. For that, we extend the general idea of Boolean map saliency towards a context-aware approach by taking into consideration sparse keypoint annotations by humans. We show that this approach allows for an automated derivation of different object representations, such as binary maps or bounding boxes so that detection models can be trained on different annotation variants and the problem of providently detecting vehicles at **night** can be tackled from different perspectives. With that, we provide further powerful tools and methods to study the problem of detecting vehicles at **night** before they are actually visible.

> ABSTRACT  :  Developing and integrating advanced image sensors with novel algorithms in camera systems are prevalent with the increasing demand for computational photography and imaging on mobile platforms. However, the lack of high-quality data for research and the rare opportunity for in-depth exchange of views from industry and academia constrain the development of mobile intelligent photography and imaging (MIPI). To bridge the gap, we introduce the first MIPI challenge, including five tracks focusing on novel image sensors and imaging algorithms. In this paper, RGBW Joint Fusion and Denoise, one of the five tracks, working on the fusion of binning-mode RGBW to Bayer, is introduced. The participants were provided with a new dataset including 70 (training) and 15 (validation) scenes of high-quality RGBW and Bayer pairs. In addition, for each scene, RGBW of different noise levels was provided at 24dB and 42dB. All the data were captured using an RGBW sensor in both outdoor and indoor conditions. The final results are evaluated using objective metrics, including PSNR, SSIM}, LPIPS, and KLD. A detailed description of all models developed in this challenge is provided in this paper. More details of this challenge and the link to the dataset can be found at https://github.com/mipi-challenge/MIPI2022.  
### Multi-stage image denoising with the wavelet transform. (arXiv:2209.12394v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used for image denoising via automatically mining accurate structure information. However, most of existing CNNs depend on enlarging depth of designed networks to obtain better denoising performance, which may cause training difficulty. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage image denoising CNN with the wavelet transform (MWDCNN) via three stages, i.e., a dynamic convolutional block (DCB), two cascaded wavelet transform and **enhancement** blocks (WEBs) and residual block (RB). DCB uses a dynamic convolution to dynamically adjust parameters of several convolutions for making a tradeoff between denoising performance and computational costs. WEB uses a combination of signal processing technique (i.e., wavelet transformation) and discriminative learning to suppress noise for recovering more detailed information in image denoising. To further remove redundant features, RB is used to refine obtained features for improving denoising effects and reconstruct clean images via improved residual dense architectures. Experimental results show that the proposed MWDCNN outperforms some popular denoising methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative analysis. Codes are available at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/MWDCNN.

### DeepMB: Deep neural network for real-time optoacoustic image reconstruction with adjustable speed of sound. (arXiv:2206.14485v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Christoph Dehner, Guillaume Zahnd, Vasilis Ntziachristos

> ABSTRACT  :  Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a high-resolution functional imaging modality that can non-invasively access a broad range of pathophysiological phenomena by quantifying the contrast of endogenous chromophores in tissue. **Real-time** imaging is imperative to translate MSOT into clinical imaging, visualize dynamic pathophysiological changes associated with disease progression, and enable in situ diagnoses. Model-based reconstruction affords state-of-the-art optoacoustic images; however, the advanced image quality provided by model-based reconstruction remains inaccessible during real-time imaging because the algorithm is iterative and computationally demanding. Deep-learning may afford faster reconstructions for real-time optoacoustic imaging, but existing approaches only support oversimplified imaging settings and fail to generalize to in vivo data. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework, termed DeepMB, to learn the model-based reconstruction operator and infer optoacoustic images with state-of-the-art quality in 31 ms per image. DeepMB accurately generalizes to in vivo data after training on synthesized sinograms that are derived from real-world images. The framework affords in-focus images for a broad range of anatomical locations because it supports dynamic adjustment of the reconstruction speed of sound during imaging. Furthermore, DeepMB is compatible with the data rates and image sizes of modern multispectral optoacoustic tomography scanners. We evaluate DeepMB on a diverse dataset of in vivo images and demonstrate that the framework reconstructs images 1000 times faster than the iterative model-based reference method while affording near-identical image qualities. Accurate and real-time image reconstructions with DeepMB can enable full access to the high-resolution and multispectral contrast of handheld optoacoustic tomography.

### Fast online ranking with fairness of **exposure**. (arXiv:2209.13019v1 [cs.IR])
- Authors : Nicolas Usunier, Virginie Do, Elvis Dohmatob
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13019](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13019)
> ABSTRACT  :  As recommender systems become increasingly central for sorting and prioritizing the content available online, they have a growing impact on the opportunities or revenue of their items producers. For instance, they influence which recruiter a resume is recommended to, or to whom and how much a music track, video or news article is being exposed. This calls for recommendation approaches that not only maximize (a proxy of) user satisfaction, but also consider some notion of fairness in the **exposure** of items or groups of items. Formally, such recommendations are usually obtained by maximizing a concave objective function in the space of randomized rankings. When the total **exposure** of an item is defined as the sum of its **exposure** over users, the optimal rankings of every users become coupled, which makes the optimization process challenging. Existing approaches to find these rankings either solve the global optimization problem in a batch setting, i.e., for all users at once, which makes them inapplicable at scale, or are based on heuristics that have weak theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose the first efficient online algorithm to optimize concave objective functions in the space of rankings which applies to every concave and smooth objective function, such as the ones found for fairness of **exposure**. Based on online variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, we show that our algorithm is computationally fast, generating rankings on-the-fly with computation cost dominated by the sort operation, memory efficient, and has strong theoretical guarantees. Compared to baseline policies that only maximize user-side performance, our algorithm allows to incorporate complex fairness of **exposure** criteria in the recommendations with negligible computational overhead.

### On Extending Amdahl's law to Learn Computer Performance. (arXiv:2110.07822v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  The problem of learning parallel computer performance is investigated in the context of multicore processors. Given a fixed workload, the effect of varying system configuration on performance is sought. Conventionally, the performance speedup due to a single resource **enhancement** is formulated using Amdahl's law. However, in case of multiple configurable resources the conventional formulation results in several disconnected speedup equations that cannot be combined together to determine the overall speedup. To solve this problem, we propose to (1) extend Amdahl's law to accommodate multiple configurable resources into the overall speedup equation, and (2) transform the speedup equation into a multivariable regression problem suitable for machine learning. Using experimental data from fifty-eight tests spanning two benchmarks (SPECCPU 2017 and PCMark 10) and four hardware platforms (Intel Xeon 8180M, AMD EPYC 7702P, Intel CoffeeLake 8700K, and AMD Ryzen 3900X), analytical models are developed and cross-validated. Findings indicate that in most cases, the models result in an average cross-validated accuracy higher than 95%, thereby validating the proposed extension of Amdahl's law. The proposed methodology enables rapid generation of multivariable analytical models to support future industrial development, optimization, and simulation needs.
