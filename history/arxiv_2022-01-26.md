> ABSTRACT  :  Automatic detection of polyps is challenging because different polyps vary greatly, while the changes between polyps and their analogues are small. The state-of-the-art methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, they may fail due to lack of training data, resulting in high rates of missed detection and false positives (FPs). In order to solve these problems, our method combines the two-dimensional (2-D) CNN-based real-time object detector network with spatiotemporal information. Firstly, we use a 2-D detector network to detect static images and frames, and based on the detector network, we propose two feature **enhancement** modules-the FP Relearning Module (FPRM) to make the detector network learning more about the features of FPs for higher precision, and the Image Style Transfer Module (ISTM) to enhance the features of polyps for sensitivity improvement. In video detection, we integrate spatiotemporal information, which uses Structural Similarity (SSIM) to measure the similarity between video frames. Finally, we propose the Inter-frame Similarity Correlation Unit (ISCU) to combine the results obtained by the detector network and frame similarity to make the final decision. We verify our method on both private databases and publicly available databases. Experimental results show that these modules and units provide a performance improvement compared with the baseline method. Comparison with the state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed method outperforms the existing ones which can meet real-time constraints. It's demonstrated that our method provides a performance improvement in sensitivity, precision and specificity, and has great potential to be applied in clinical colonoscopy.  
### Revisiting L1 Loss in Super-Resolution: A Probabilistic View and Beyond. (arXiv:2201.10084v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Super-resolution as an ill-posed problem has many high-resolution candidates for a low-resolution input. However, the popular $\ell_1$ loss used to best fit the given HR image fails to consider this fundamental property of non-uniqueness in image **restoration**. In this work, we fix the missing piece in $\ell_1$ loss by formulating super-resolution with neural networks as a probabilistic model. It shows that $\ell_1$ loss is equivalent to a degraded likelihood function that removes the randomness from the learning process. By introducing a data-adaptive random variable, we present a new objective function that aims at minimizing the expectation of the reconstruction error over all plausible solutions. The experimental results show consistent improvements on mainstream architectures, with no extra parameter or computing cost at inference time.

> ABSTRACT  :  Human silhouette segmentation, which is originally defined in computer vision, has achieved promising results for understanding human activities. However, the physical limitation makes existing systems based on optical cameras suffer from severe performance degradation under low illumination, smoke, and/or opaque obstruction conditions. To overcome such limitations, in this paper, we propose to utilize the radio signals, which can traverse obstacles and are unaffected by the lighting conditions to achieve silhouette segmentation. The proposed RFMask framework is composed of three modules. It first transforms RF signals captured by millimeter wave radar on two planes into spatial domain and suppress interference with the signal processing module. Then, it locates human reflections on RF frames and extract features from surrounding signals with human detection module. Finally, the extracted features from RF frames are aggregated with an attention based mask generation module. To verify our proposed framework, we collect a dataset containing 804,760 radio frames and 402,380 camera frames with human activities under various scenes. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve impressive human silhouette segmentation even under the challenging scenarios(such as **low light** and occlusion scenarios) where traditional optical-camera-based methods fail. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation towards segmenting human silhouette based on millimeter wave signals. We hope that our work can serve as a baseline and inspire further research that perform vision tasks with radio signals. The dataset and codes will be made in public.

> ABSTRACT  :  Document images can be affected by many degradation scenarios, which cause recognition and processing difficulties. In this age of digitization, it is important to denoise them for proper usage. To address this challenge, we present a new encoder-decoder architecture based on vision transformers to enhance both machine-printed and handwritten document images, in an end-to-end fashion. The encoder operates directly on the pixel patches with their positional information without the use of any convolutional layers, while the decoder reconstructs a clean image from the encoded patches. Conducted experiments show a superiority of the proposed model compared to the state-of the-art methods on several DIBCO benchmarks. Code and models will be publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/dali92002/DocEnTR}.

> ABSTRACT  :  Photon counting spectral CT (PCCT) can produce reconstructed attenuation maps in different energy channels, reflecting energy properties of the scanned object. Due to the limited photon numbers and the non-ideal detector response of each energy channel, the reconstructed images usually contain much noise. With the development of Deep Learning (DL) technique, different kinds of DL-based models have been proposed for noise reduction. However, most of the models require clean data set as the training labels, which are not always available in medical imaging field. Inspiring by the similarities of each channel's reconstructed image, we proposed a self-supervised learning based PCCT image **enhancement** framework via multi-spectral channels (S2MS). In S2MS framework, both the input and output labels are noisy images. Specifically, one single channel image was used as output while images of other single channels and channel-sum image were used as input to train the network, which can fully use the spectral data information without extra cost. The simulation results based on the AAPM Low-dose CT Challenge database showed that the proposed S2MS model can suppress the noise and preserve details more effectively in comparison with the traditional DL models, which has potential to improve the image quality of PCCT in clinical applications.

> ABSTRACT  :  Many applications in image-guided surgery and therapy require fast and reliable non-linear, multi-modal image registration. Recently proposed unsupervised deep learning-based registration methods have demonstrated superior performance compared to iterative methods in just a fraction of the time. Most of the learning-based methods have focused on mono-modal image registration. The extension to multi-modal registration depends on the use of an appropriate similarity function, such as the mutual information (MI). We propose guiding the training of a deep learning-based registration method with MI estimation between an image-pair in an end-to-end trainable network. Our results show that a small, 2-layer network produces competitive results in both mono- and multimodal registration, with sub-second run-times. Comparisons to both iterative and deep learning-based methods show that our MI-based method produces topologically and qualitatively superior results with an extremely low rate of non-diffeomorphic transformations. **Real-time** clinical application will benefit from a better visual matching of anatomical structures and less registration failures/outliers.

> ABSTRACT  :  Computed tomography is widely used as an imaging tool to visualize three-dimensional structures with expressive bone-soft tissue contrast. However, CT resolution and radiation dose are tightly entangled, highlighting the importance of low-dose CT combined with sophisticated denoising algorithms. Most data-driven denoising techniques are based on deep neural networks and, therefore, contain hundreds of thousands of trainable parameters, making them incomprehensible and prone to prediction failures. Developing understandable and robust denoising algorithms achieving state-of-the-art performance helps to minimize radiation dose while maintaining data integrity. This work presents an open-source CT denoising framework based on the idea of **bilateral** filtering. We propose a **bilateral** filter that can be incorporated into a deep learning pipeline and optimized in a purely data-driven way by calculating the gradient flow toward its hyperparameters and its input. Denoising in pure image-to-image pipelines and across different domains such as raw detector data and reconstructed volume, using a differentiable backprojection layer, is demonstrated. Although only using three spatial parameters and one range parameter per filter layer, the proposed denoising pipelines can compete with deep state-of-the-art denoising architectures with several hundred thousand parameters. Competitive denoising performance is achieved on x-ray microscope bone data (0.7053 and 33.10) and the 2016 Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset (0.9674 and 43.07) in terms of SSIM and PSNR. Due to the extremely low number of trainable parameters with well-defined effect, prediction reliance and data integrity is guaranteed at any time in the proposed pipelines, in contrast to most other deep learning-based denoising architectures.  
### Towards Lightweight Neural Animation : Exploration of Neural Network Pruning in Mixture of Experts-based Animation Models. (arXiv:2201.04042v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  In the past few years, neural character animation has emerged and offered an automatic method for animating virtual characters. Their motion is synthesized by a neural network. Controlling this movement in **real time** with a user-defined control signal is also an important task in video games for example. Solutions based on fully-connected layers (MLPs) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have given impressive results in generating and controlling various movements with close-range interactions between the environment and the virtual character. However, a major shortcoming of fully-connected layers is their computational and memory cost which may lead to sub-optimized solution. In this work, we apply pruning algorithms to compress an MLP- MoE neural network in the context of interactive character animation, which reduces its number of parameters and accelerates its computation time with a trade-off between this acceleration and the synthesized motion quality. This work demonstrates that, with the same number of experts and parameters, the pruned model produces less motion artifacts than the dense model and the learned high-level motion features are similar for both

> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we propose a deformable convolution-based generative adversarial network (DCNGAN) for perceptual quality **enhancement** of compressed videos. DCNGAN is also adaptive to the quantization parameters (QPs). Compared with optical flows, deformable convolutions are more effective and efficient to align frames. Deformable convolutions can operate on multiple frames, thus leveraging more temporal information, which is beneficial for enhancing the perceptual quality of compressed videos. Instead of aligning frames in a pairwise manner, the deformable convolution can process multiple frames simultaneously, which leads to lower computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DCNGAN outperforms other state-of-the-art compressed video quality **enhancement** algorithms.

- Authors : Renchunzi Xie, Hongxin Wei, Lei Feng, Bo An
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06001](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06001)
> ABSTRACT  :  This paper studies weakly supervised domain adaptation(WSDA) problem, where we only have access to the source domain with noisy labels, from which we need to transfer useful information to the unlabeled target domain. Although there have been a few studies on this problem, most of them only exploit unidirectional relationships from the source domain to the target domain. In this paper, we propose a universal paradigm called GearNet to exploit **bilateral** relationships between the two domains. Specifically, we take the two domains as different inputs to train two models alternately, and asymmetrical Kullback-Leibler loss is used for selectively matching the predictions of the two models in the same domain. This interactive learning schema enables implicit label noise canceling and exploits correlations between the source and target domains. Therefore, our GearNet has the great potential to boost the performance of a wide range of existing WSDL methods. Comprehensive experimental results show that the performance of existing methods can be significantly improved by equipping with our GearNet.

> ABSTRACT  :  Deep-learning based methods have shown their advantages in audio coding over traditional ones but limited attention has been paid on real-time communications (RTC). This paper proposes the TFNet, an end-to-end neural audio codec with low latency for RTC. It takes an encoder-temporal filtering-decoder paradigm that seldom being investigated in audio coding. An interleaved structure is proposed for temporal filtering to capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. Furthermore, with end-to-end optimization, the TFNet is jointly optimized with speech **enhancement** and packet loss concealment, yielding a one-for-all network for three tasks. Both subjective and objective results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed TFNet.
