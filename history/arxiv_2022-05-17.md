> ABSTRACT  :  Image denoising is an important low-level computer vision task, which aims to reconstruct a noise-free and high-quality image from a noisy image. With the development of deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been gradually applied and achieved great success in image denoising, image compression, image **enhancement**, etc. Recently, Transformer has been a hot technique, which is widely used to tackle computer vision tasks. However, few Transformer-based methods have been proposed for low-level vision tasks. In this paper, we proposed an image denoising network structure based on Transformer, which is named DenSformer. DenSformer consists of three modules, including a preprocessing module, a local-global feature extraction module, and a reconstruction module. Specifically, the local-global feature extraction module consists of several Sformer groups, each of which has several ETransformer layers and a convolution layer, together with a residual connection. These Sformer groups are densely skip-connected to fuse the feature of different layers, and they jointly capture the local and global information from the given noisy images. We conduct our model on comprehensive experiments. Experimental results prove that our DenSformer achieves improvement compared to some state-of-the-art methods, both for the synthetic noise data and real noise data, in the objective and subjective evaluations.

> ABSTRACT  :  We present a large-scale synthetic dataset for novel view synthesis consisting of ~300k images rendered from nearly 2000 complex scenes using high-quality ray tracing at high resolution (1600 x 1600 pixels). The dataset is orders of magnitude larger than existing synthetic datasets for novel view synthesis, thus providing a large unified benchmark for both training and evaluation. Using 4 distinct sources of high-quality 3D meshes, the scenes of our dataset exhibit challenging variations in camera views, lighting, shape, materials, and textures. Because our dataset is too large for existing methods to process, we propose Sparse Voxel Light Field (SVLF), an efficient voxel-based light field approach for novel view synthesis that achieves comparable performance to **NeRF** on synthetic data, while being an order of magnitude faster to train and two orders of magnitude faster to render. SVLF achieves this speed by relying on a sparse voxel octree, careful voxel sampling (requiring only a handful of queries per ray), and reduced network structure; as well as ground truth depth maps at training time. Our dataset is generated by NViSII, a Python-based ray tracing renderer, which is designed to be simple for non-experts to use and share, flexible and powerful through its use of scripting, and able to create high-quality and physically-based rendered images. Experiments with a subset of our dataset allow us to compare standard methods like **NeRF** and mip-**NeRF** for single-scene modeling, and pixel**NeRF** for category-level modeling, pointing toward the need for future improvements in this area.  
### Fused Deep Neural Network based Transfer Learning in Occluded Face Classification and Person re-Identification. (arXiv:2205.07203v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Recent period of pandemic has brought person identification even with occluded face image a great importance with increased number of mask usage. This paper aims to recognize the occlusion of one of four types in face images. Various transfer learning methods were tested, and the results show that MobileNet V2 with Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) performs better than any other Transfer Learning methods, with a perfect accuracy of 99% in classification of images as with or without occlusion and if with occlusion, then the type of occlusion. In parallel, identifying the Region of interest from the device captured image is done. This extracted Region of interest is utilised in face identification. Such a face identification process is done using the ResNet model with its Caffe implementation. To reduce the execution time, after the face occlusion type was recognized the person was searched to confirm their face image in the registered database. The face label of the person obtained from both simultaneous processes was verified for their matching score. If the matching score was above 90, the recognized label of the person was logged into a file with their name, type of mask, date, and time of recognition. MobileNetV2 is a lightweight framework which can also be used in embedded or IoT devices to perform **real time** detection and identification in suspicious areas of investigations using CCTV footages. When MobileNetV2 was combined with GRU, a reliable accuracy was obtained. The data provided in the paper belong to two categories, being either collected from Google Images for occlusion classification, face recognition, and facial landmarks, or collected in fieldwork. The motive behind this research is to identify and log person details which could serve surveillance activities in society-based e-governance.  
### PillarNet: High-Performance Pillar-based 3D Object Detection. (arXiv:2205.07403v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Guangsheng Shi, Ruifeng Li, Chao Ma
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07403](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07403)
> ABSTRACT  :  **Real-time** and high-performance 3D object detection is of critical importance for autonomous driving. Recent top-performing 3D object detectors mainly rely on point-based or 3D voxel-based convolutions, which are both computationally inefficient for onboard deployment. In contrast, pillar-based methods use merely 2D convolutions, which consume less computation resources, but they lag far behind their voxel-based counterparts in detection accuracy. In this paper, by examining the primary performance gap between pillar- and voxel-based detectors, we develop a real-time and high-performance pillar-based detector, dubbed PillarNet. The proposed PillarNet consists of a powerful encoder network for effective pillar feature learning, a neck network for spatial-semantic feature fusion and the commonly used detect head. Using only 2D convolutions, PillarNet is flexible to an optional pillar size and compatible with classical 2D CNN backbones, such as VGGNet and ResNet. Additionally, PillarNet benefits from an orientation-decoupled IoU regression loss along with the IoU-aware prediction branch. Extensive experimental results on the large-scale nuScenes Dataset and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that the proposed PillarNet performs well over the state-of-the-art 3D detectors in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.  
### **Low-light** Image **Enhancement** Using the Cell Vibration Model. (arXiv:2006.02271v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Xiaozhou Lei, Zixiang Fei, Wenju Zhou, Huiyu Zhou, Minrui Fei
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02271](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02271)
> ABSTRACT  :  **Low light** very likely leads to the degradation of an image's quality and even causes visual task failures. Existing image **enhancement** technologies are prone to over**enhancement**, color distortion or time consumption, and their adaptability is fairly limited. Therefore, we propose a new single **low-light** image lightness **enhancement** method. First, an energy model is presented based on the analysis of membrane vibrations induced by photon stimulations. Then, based on the unique mathematical properties of the energy model and combined with the gamma correction model, a new global lightness **enhancement** model is proposed. Furthermore, a special relationship between image lightness and gamma intensity is found. Finally, a local fusion strategy, including segmentation, filtering and fusion, is proposed to optimize the local details of the global lightness **enhancement** images. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to nine state-of-the-art methods in avoiding color distortion, restoring the textures of **dark** areas, reproducing natural colors and reducing time cost. The image source and code will be released at https://github.com/leixiaozhou/CDEFmethod.

> ABSTRACT  :  During the last years, the emerging field of Augmented &amp; Virtual Reality (AR-VR) has seen tremendousgrowth. At the same time there is a trend to develop low cost high-quality AR systems where computing poweris in demand. Feature points are extensively used in these real-time frame-rate and 3D applications, thereforeefficient high-speed feature detectors are necessary. Corners are such special features and often are used as thefirst step in the marker alignment in Augmented Reality (AR). Corners are also used in image registration andrecognition, tracking, SLAM, robot path finding and 2D or 3D object detection and retrieval. Therefore thereis a large number of corner detection algorithms but most of them are too computationally intensive for use inreal-time applications of any complexity. Many times the border of the image is a convex polygon. For thisspecial, but quite common case, we have developed a specific algorithm, cMinMax. The proposed algorithmis faster, approximately by a factor of 5 compared to the widely used Harris Corner Detection algorithm. Inaddition is highly parallelizable. The algorithm is suitable for the fast registration of markers in augmentedreality systems and in applications where a computationally efficient **real time** feature detector is necessary.The algorithm can also be extended to N-dimensional polyhedrons.  
### AASeg: Attention Aware Network for Real Time Semantic Segmentation. (arXiv:2108.04349v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Abhinav Sagar

> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we present a new network named Attention Aware Network (AASeg) for **real time** semantic image segmentation. Our network incorporates spatial and channel information using Spatial Attention (SA) and Channel Attention (CA) modules respectively. It also uses dense local multi-scale context information using Multi Scale Context (MSC) module. The feature maps are concatenated individually to produce the final segmentation map. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a comprehensive analysis, quantitative experimental results and ablation study using Cityscapes, ADE20K and Camvid datasets. Our network performs better than most previous architectures with a 74.4\% Mean IOU on Cityscapes test dataset while running at 202.7 FPS.  
### Generative Flows as a General Purpose Solution for Inverse Problems. (arXiv:2110.13285v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : 
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13285](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13285)
> ABSTRACT  :  Due to the success of generative flows to model data distributions, they have been explored in inverse problems. Given a pre-trained generative flow, previous work proposed to minimize the 2-norm of the latent variables as a regularization term. The intuition behind it was to ensure high likelihood latent variables that produce the closest **restoration**. However, high-likelihood latent variables may generate unrealistic samples as we show in our experiments. We therefore propose a solver to directly produce high-likelihood reconstructions. We hypothesize that our approach could make generative flows a general purpose solver for inverse problems. Furthermore, we propose 1 x 1 coupling functions to introduce permutations in a generative flow. It has the advantage that its inverse does not require to be calculated in the generation process. Finally, we evaluate our method for denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and colorization. We observe a compelling improvement of our method over prior works.  
### CoSSL: Co-Learning of Representation and Classifier for Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Learning. (arXiv:2112.04564v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Yue Fan, Dengxin Dai, Bernt Schiele
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04564](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04564)
> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we propose a novel co-learning framework (CoSSL) with decoupled representation learning and classifier learning for imbalanced SSL. To handle the data imbalance, we devise Tail-class Feature **Enhancement** (TFE) for classifier learning. Furthermore, the current evaluation protocol for imbalanced SSL focuses only on balanced test sets, which has limited practicality in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we further conduct a comprehensive evaluation under various shifted test distributions. In experiments, we show that our approach outperforms other methods over a large range of shifted distributions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets ranging from CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, to Food-101. Our code will be made publicly available.  
### Lightweight **HDR** Camera ISP for Robust Perception in Dynamic Illumination Conditions via Fourier Adversarial Networks. (arXiv:2204.01795v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Pranjay Shyam, Sandeep Singh, Jin Yoon, Soo Kim
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01795](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01795)
> ABSTRACT  :  The limited dynamic range of commercial compact camera sensors results in an inaccurate representation of scenes with varying illumination conditions, adversely affecting image quality and subsequently limiting the performance of underlying image processing algorithms. Current state-of-the-art (SoTA) convolutional neural networks (CNN) are developed as post-processing techniques to independently recover under-/over-exposed images. However, when applied to images containing real-world degradations such as glare, high-beam, color bleeding with varying noise intensity, these algorithms amplify the degradations, further degrading image quality. We propose a lightweight two-stage image **enhancement** algorithm sequentially balancing illumination and noise removal using frequency priors for structural guidance to overcome these limitations. Furthermore, to ensure realistic image quality, we leverage the relationship between frequency and spatial domain properties of an image and propose a Fourier spectrum-based adversarial framework (AFNet) for consistent image **enhancement** under varying illumination conditions. While current formulations of image **enhancement** are envisioned as post-processing techniques, we examine if such an algorithm could be extended to integrate the functionality of the Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline within the camera sensor benefiting from RAW sensor data and lightweight CNN architecture. Based on quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we also examine the practicality and effects of image **enhancement** techniques on the performance of common perception tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation in varying illumination conditions.  
### An Empirical Study of Remote Sensing Pretraining. (arXiv:2204.02825v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Deep learning has largely reshaped remote sensing (RS) research for aerial image understanding and made a great success. Nevertheless, most of the existing deep models are initialized with the ImageNet pretrained weights. Since natural images inevitably present a large domain gap relative to aerial images, probably limiting the finetuning performance on downstream aerial scene tasks. This issue motivates us to conduct an empirical study of remote sensing pretraining (RSP) on aerial images. To this end, we train different networks from scratch with the help of the largest RS scene recognition dataset up to now -- MillionAID, to obtain a series of RS pretrained backbones, including both convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision transformers such as **Swin** and ViTAE, which have shown promising performance on computer vision tasks. Then, we investigate the impact of RSP on representative downstream tasks including scene recognition, semantic segmentation, object detection, and change detection using these CNN and vision transformer backbones. Empirical study shows that RSP can help deliver distinctive performances in scene recognition tasks and in perceiving RS related semantics such as "Bridge" and "Airplane". We also find that, although RSP mitigates the data discrepancies of traditional ImageNet pretraining on RS images, it may still suffer from task discrepancies, where downstream tasks require different representations from scene recognition tasks. These findings call for further research efforts on both large-scale pretraining datasets and effective pretraining methods. The codes and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/ViTAE-Transformer/ViTAE-Transformer-Remote-Sensing.

> ABSTRACT  :  For agents at a contact centre receiving calls, the most important piece of information is the reason for a given call. An agent cannot provide support on a call if they do not know why a customer is calling. In this paper we describe our implementation of a commercial system to detect Purpose of Call statements in English business call transcripts in **real time**. We present a detailed analysis of types of Purpose of Call statements and language patterns related to them, discuss an approach to collect rich training data by bootstrapping from a set of rules to a neural model, and describe a hybrid model which consists of a transformer-based classifier and a set of rules by leveraging insights from the analysis of call transcripts. The model achieved 88.6 F1 on average in various types of business calls when tested on real life data and has low inference time. We reflect on the challenges and design decisions when developing and deploying the system.

### Building a 3-Player Mahjong AI using Deep Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2202.12847v3 [cs.AI] UPDATED)
- Authors : Xiangyu Zhao

> ABSTRACT  :  Mahjong is a popular multi-player imperfect-information game developed in China in the late 19th-century, with some very challenging features for AI research. Sanma, being a 3-player variant of the Japanese Riichi Mahjong, possesses unique characteristics including fewer tiles and, consequently, a more aggressive playing style. It is thus challenging and of great research interest in its own right, but has not yet been explored. In this paper, we present Meowjong, an AI for Sanma using deep reinforcement learning. We define an informative and compact 2-dimensional data structure for encoding the observable information in a Sanma game. We pre-train 5 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for Sanma's 5 actions -- discard, Pon, Kan, Kita and Riichi, and enhance the major action's model, namely the discard model, via self-play reinforcement learning using the Monte Carlo policy gradient method. Meowjong's models achieve test accuracies comparable with AIs for 4-player Mahjong through supervised learning, and gain a significant further **enhancement** from reinforcement learning. Being the first ever AI in Sanma, we claim that Meowjong stands as a state-of-the-art in this game.  
### Neurochaos Feature Transformation and Classification for Imbalanced Learning. (arXiv:2205.06742v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Learning from limited and imbalanced data is a challenging problem in the Artificial Intelligence community. **Real-time** scenarios demand decision-making from rare events wherein the data are typically imbalanced. These situations commonly arise in medical applications, cybersecurity, catastrophic predictions etc. This motivates the development of learning algorithms capable of learning from imbalanced data. Human brain effortlessly learns from imbalanced data. Inspired by the chaotic neuronal firing in the human brain, a novel learning algorithm namely Neurochaos Learning (NL) was recently proposed. NL is categorized in three blocks: Feature Transformation, Neurochaos Feature Extraction (CFX), and Classification. In this work, the efficacy of neurochaos feature transformation and extraction for classification in imbalanced learning is studied. We propose a unique combination of neurochaos based feature transformation and extraction with traditional ML algorithms. The explored datasets in this study revolve around medical diagnosis, banknote fraud detection, environmental applications and spoken-digit classification. In this study, experiments are performed in both high and low training sample regime. In the former, five out of nine datasets have shown a performance boost in terms of macro F1-score after using CFX features. The highest performance boost obtained is 25.97% for Statlog (Heart) dataset using CFX+Decision Tree. In the low training sample regime (from just one to nine training samples per class), the highest performance boost of 144.38% is obtained for Haberman's Survival dataset using CFX+Random Forest. NL offers enormous flexibility of combining CFX with any ML classifier to boost its performance, especially for learning tasks with limited and imbalanced data.
