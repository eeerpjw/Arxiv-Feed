> ABSTRACT  :  Density-based and classification-based methods have ruled unsupervised anomaly detection in recent years, while reconstruction-based methods are rarely mentioned for the poor reconstruction ability and low performance. However, the latter requires no costly extra training samples for the unsupervised training that is more practical, so this paper focuses on improving this kind of method and proposes a novel Omni-frequency Channel-selection Reconstruction (OCR-GAN) network to handle anomaly detection task in a perspective of frequency. Concretely, we propose a Frequency Decoupling (FD) module to decouple the input image into different frequency components and model the reconstruction process as a combination of parallel omni-frequency image **restoration**s, as we observe a significant difference in the frequency distribution of normal and abnormal images. Given the correlation among multiple frequencies, we further propose a Channel Selection (CS) module that performs frequency interaction among different encoders by adaptively selecting different channels. Abundant experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over different kinds of methods, e.g., achieving a new state-of-the-art 98.3 detection AUC on the MVTec AD dataset without extra training data that markedly surpasses the reconstruction-based baseline by +38.1 and the current SOTA method by +0.3.

> ABSTRACT  :  The increasing need of restoring high-resolution Hyper-Spectral (HS) images is determining a growing reliance on Computer Vision-based processing to enhance the clarity of the image content. HS images can, in fact, suffer from degradation effects or artefacts caused by instrument limitations. This paper focuses on a procedure aimed at reducing the degradation effects, frequency-dependent blur and noise, in Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) images in reflection geometry. It describes the application of a joint deblurring and denoising approach that had been previously proved to be effective for the **restoration** of THz-TDS images in transmission geometry, but that had never been tested in reflection modality. This mode is often the only one that can be effectively used in most cases, for example when analyzing objects that are either opaque in the THz range, or that cannot be displaced from their location (e.g., museums), such as those of cultural interest. Compared to transmission mode, reflection geometry introduces, however, further distortion to THz data, neglected in existing literature. In this work, we successfully implement image deblurring and denoising of both uniform-shape samples (a contemporary 1 Euro cent coin and an inlaid pendant) and samples with the uneven reliefs and corrosion products on the surface which make the analysis of the object particularly complex (an ancient Roman silver coin). The study demonstrates the ability of image processing to restore data in the 0.25 - 6 THz range, spanning over more than four octaves, and providing the foundation for future analytical approaches of cultural heritage using the far-infrared spectrum still not sufficiently investigated in literature.  
### Boundary Corrected Multi-scale Fusion Network for **Real-time** Semantic Segmentation. (arXiv:2203.00436v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Image semantic segmentation aims at the pixel-level classification of images, which has requirements for both accuracy and speed in practical application. Existing semantic segmentation methods mainly rely on the high-resolution input to achieve high accuracy and do not meet the requirements of inference time. Although some methods focus on high-speed scene parsing with lightweight architectures, they can not fully mine semantic features under low computation with relatively low performance. To realize the real-time and high-precision segmentation, we propose a new method named Boundary Corrected Multi-scale Fusion Network, which uses the designed Low-resolution Multi-scale Fusion Module to extract semantic information. Moreover, to deal with boundary errors caused by low-resolution feature map fusion, we further design an additional Boundary Corrected Loss to constrain overly smooth features. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance of accuracy and speed for the real-time semantic segmentation.

### Learned end-to-end high-resolution lensless fiber imaging toward intraoperative real-time cancer diagnosis. (arXiv:2203.00008v1 [physics.med-ph])

> ABSTRACT  :  Endomicroscopy is indispensable for minimally invasive diagnostics in clinical practice. For optical keyhole monitoring of surgical interventions, high-resolution fiber endoscopic imaging is considered to be very promising, especially in combination with label-free imaging techniques to realize in vivo diagnosis. However, the inherent honeycomb-artifacts of coherent fiber bundles (CFB) reduce the resolution and limit the clinical applications. We propose an end-to-end lensless fiber imaging scheme toward intraoperative real-time cancer diagnosis. The framework includes resolution **enhancement** and classification networks that use single-shot fiber bundle images to provide both high-resolution images and tumor diagnosis result. The well-trained resolution **enhancement** network not only recovers high-resolution features beyond the physical limitations of CFB, but also helps improving tumor recognition rate. Especially for glioblastoma, the resolution **enhancement** network helps increasing the classification accuracy from 90.8% to 95.6%. The novel technique can enable histological real-time imaging through lensless fiber endoscopy and is promising for rapid and minimal-invasive intraoperative diagnosis in clinics.  
### Iterative Optimization of Quarter Sampling Masks for Non-Regular Sampling Sensors. (arXiv:2203.00305v1 [eess.IV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Non-regular sampling can reduce aliasing at the expense of noise. Recently, it has been shown that non-regular sampling can be carried out using a conventional regular imaging sensor when the surface of its individual pixels is partially covered. This technique is called quarter sampling (also 1/4 sampling), since only one quarter of each pixel is sensitive to light. For this purpose, the choice of a proper sampling mask is crucial to achieve a high reconstruction quality. In the scope of this work, we present an iterative algorithm to improve an arbitrary quarter sampling mask which results in a continuous increase of the reconstruction quality. In terms of the reconstruction algorithms, we test two simple algorithms, namely, linear interpolation and nearest neighbor interpolation, as well as two more sophisticated algorithms, namely, steering kernel regression and frequency selective extrapolation. Besides PSNR gains of +0.31 dB to +0.68 dB relative to a random quarter sampling mask resulting from our optimized mask, visually noticeable **enhancement**s are perceptible.

### Analysis of Digitalized ECG Signals Based on Artificial Intelligence and Spectral Analysis Methods Specialized in ARVC. (arXiv:2203.00504v1 [eess.SP])

> ABSTRACT  :  Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that appears between the second and forth decade of a patient's life, being responsible for 20% of sudden cardiac deaths before the age of 35. The effective and punctual diagnosis of this disease based on Electrocardiograms (ECGs) could have a vital role in reducing premature cardiovascular mortality. In our analysis, we firstly outline the digitalization process of paper-based ECG signals enhanced by a spatial filter aiming to eliminate **dark** regions in the dataset's images that do not correspond to ECG waveform, producing undesirable noise. Next, we propose the utilization of a low-complexity convolutional neural network for the detection of an arrhythmogenic heart disease, that has not been studied through the usage of deep learning methodology to date, achieving high classification accuracy on a disease the major identification criterion of which are infinitesimal millivolt variations in the ECG's morphology, in contrast with other arrhythmogenic abnormalities. Finally, by performing spectral analysis we investigate significant differentiations in the field of frequencies between normal ECGs and ECGs corresponding to patients suffering from ARVC. The overall research carried out in this article highlights the importance of integrating mathematical methods into the examination and effective diagnosis of various diseases, aiming to a substantial contribution to their successful treatment.

### Debiased-CAM to mitigate systematic error with faithful visual explanations of machine learning. (arXiv:2201.12835v2 [cs.HC] UPDATED)
- Authors : Wencan Zhang, Mariella Dimiccoli
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12835](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12835)
> ABSTRACT  :  Model explanations such as saliency maps can improve user trust in AI by highlighting important features for a prediction. However, these become distorted and misleading when explaining predictions of images that are subject to systematic error (bias). Furthermore, the distortions persist despite model fine-tuning on images biased by different factors (blur, color temperature, day/**night**). We present Debiased-CAM to recover explanation faithfulness across various bias types and levels by training a multi-input, multi-task model with auxiliary tasks for explanation and bias level predictions. In simulation studies, the approach not only enhanced prediction accuracy, but also generated highly faithful explanations about these predictions as if the images were unbiased. In user studies, debiased explanations improved user task performance, perceived truthfulness and perceived helpfulness. Debiased training can provide a versatile platform for robust performance and explanation faithfulness for a wide range of applications with data biases.
