> ABSTRACT  :  Light adaptation or brightness correction is a key step in improving the contrast and visual appeal of an image. There are multiple light-related tasks (for example, **low-light** **enhancement** and **exposure** correction) and previous studies have mainly investigated these tasks individually. However, it is interesting to consider whether these light-related tasks can be executed by a unified model, especially considering that our visual system adapts to external light in such way. In this study, we propose a biologically inspired method to handle light-related image-**enhancement** tasks with a unified network (called LA-Net). First, a frequency-based decomposition module is designed to decouple the common and characteristic sub-problems of light-related tasks into two pathways. Then, a new module is built inspired by biological visual adaptation to achieve unified light adaptation in the low-frequency pathway. In addition, noise suppression or detail **enhancement** is achieved effectively in the high-frequency pathway regardless of the light levels. Extensive experiments on three tasks -- **low-light** **enhancement**, **exposure** correction, and tone mapping -- demonstrate that the proposed method almost obtains state-of-the-art performance compared with recent methods designed for these individual tasks.  
### Self-Supervised Class-Cognizant Few-Shot Classification. (arXiv:2202.08149v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Unsupervised learning is argued to be the **dark** matter of human intelligence. To build in this direction, this paper focuses on unsupervised learning from an abundance of unlabeled data followed by few-shot fine-tuning on a downstream classification task. To this aim, we extend a recent study on adopting contrastive learning for self-supervised pre-training by incorporating class-level cognizance through iterative clustering and re-ranking and by expanding the contrastive optimization loss to account for it. To our knowledge, our experimentation both in standard and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that we set a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) in (5-way, 1 and 5-shot) settings of standard mini-ImageNet benchmark as well as the (5-way, 5 and 20-shot) settings of cross-domain CDFSL benchmark.

### Unpaired Single-Image Depth Synthesis with cycle-consistent Wasserstein GANs. (arXiv:2103.16938v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  **Real-time** estimation of actual environment depth is an essential module for various autonomous system tasks such as localization, obstacle detection and pose estimation. During the last decade of machine learning, extensive deployment of deep learning methods to computer vision tasks yielded successful approaches for realistic depth synthesis out of a simple RGB modality. While most of these models rest on paired depth data or availability of video sequences and stereo images, there is a lack of methods facing single-image depth synthesis in an unsupervised manner. Therefore, in this study, latest advancements in the field of generative neural networks are leveraged to fully unsupervised single-image depth synthesis. To be more exact, two cycle-consistent generators for RGB-to-depth and depth-to-RGB transfer are implemented and simultaneously optimized using the Wasserstein-1 distance. To ensure plausibility of the proposed method, we apply the models to a self acquised industrial data set as well as to the renown NYU Depth v2 data set, which allows comparison with existing approaches. The observed success in this study suggests high potential for unpaired single-image depth estimation in real world applications.  
### Linear Array Network for **Low-light** Image **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2201.08996v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Convolution neural networks (CNNs) based methods have dominated the **low-light** image **enhancement** tasks due to their outstanding performance. However, the convolution operation is based on a local sliding window mechanism, which is difficult to construct the long-range dependencies of the feature maps. Meanwhile, the self-attention based global relationship aggregation methods have been widely used in computer vision, but these methods are difficult to handle high-resolution images because of the high computational complexity. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Linear Array Self-attention (LASA) mechanism, which uses only two 2-D feature encodings to construct 3-D global weights and then refines feature maps generated by convolution layers. Based on LASA, Linear Array Network (LAN) is proposed, which is superior to the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both RGB and RAW based **low-light** **enhancement** tasks with a smaller amount of parameters. The code is released in https://github.com/cuiziteng/LASA_**enhancement**.

> ABSTRACT  :  **Real-time** estimation of actual object depth is a module that is essential to performing various autonomous system tasks such as 3D reconstruction, scene understanding and condition assessment of machinery parts. During the last decade of machine learning, extensive deployment of deep learning methods to computer vision tasks has yielded approaches that succeed in achieving realistic depth synthesis out of a simple RGB modality. While most of these models are based on paired depth data or availability of video sequences and stereo images, methods for single-view depth synthesis in a fully unsupervised setting have hardly been explored. This study presents the most recent advances in the field of generative neural networks, leveraging them to perform fully unsupervised single-shot depth synthesis. Two generators for RGB-to-depth and depth-to-RGB transfer are implemented and simultaneously optimized using the Wasserstein-1 distance and a novel perceptual reconstruction term. To ensure that the proposed method is plausible, we comprehensively evaluate the models using industrial surface depth data as well as the Texas 3D Face Recognition Database and the SURREAL dataset that records body depth. The success observed in this study suggests the great potential for unsupervised single-shot depth estimation in real-world applications.

### Latent Outlier **Exposure** for Anomaly Detection with Contaminated Data. (arXiv:2202.08088v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Chen Qiu, Aodong Li, Marius Kloft, Maja Rudolph, Stephan Mandt
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08088](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08088)
> ABSTRACT  :  Anomaly detection aims at identifying data points that show systematic deviations from the majority of data in an unlabeled dataset. A common assumption is that clean training data (free of anomalies) is available, which is often violated in practice. We propose a strategy for training an anomaly detector in the presence of unlabeled anomalies that is compatible with a broad class of models. The idea is to jointly infer binary labels to each datum (normal vs. anomalous) while updating the model parameters. Inspired by outlier **exposure** (Hendrycks et al., 2018) that considers synthetically created, labeled anomalies, we thereby use a combination of two losses that share parameters: one for the normal and one for the anomalous data. We then iteratively proceed with block coordinate updates on the parameters and the most likely (latent) labels. Our experiments with several backbone models on three image datasets, 30 tabular data sets, and a video anomaly detection benchmark showed consistent and significant improvements over the baselines.

### Federated Neural Collaborative Filtering. (arXiv:2106.04405v2 [cs.IR] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  In this work, we present a federated version of the state-of-the-art Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) approach for item recommendations. The system, named FedNCF, enables learning without requiring users to disclose or transmit their raw data. Data localization preserves data privacy and complies with regulations such as the GDPR. Although federated learning enables model training without local data dissemination, the transmission of raw clients' updates raises additional privacy issues. To address this challenge, we incorporate a privacy-preserving aggregation method that satisfies the security requirements against an honest but curious entity. We argue theoretically and experimentally that existing aggregation algorithms are inconsistent with latent factor model updates. We propose an **enhancement** by decomposing the aggregation step into matrix factorization and neural network-based averaging. Experimental validation shows that FedNCF achieves comparable recommendation quality to the original NCF system, while our proposed aggregation leads to faster convergence compared to existing methods. We investigate the effectiveness of the federated recommender system and evaluate the privacy-preserving mechanism in terms of computational cost.

### SalienTrack: providing salient information for semi-automated self-tracking feedback with model explanations. (arXiv:2109.10231v3 [cs.HC] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Self-tracking can improve people's awareness of their unhealthy behaviors and support reflection to inform behavior change. Increasingly, new technologies make tracking easier, leading to large amounts of tracked data. However, much of that information is not salient for reflection and self-awareness. To tackle this burden for reflection, we created the SalienTrack framework, which aims to 1) identify salient tracking events, 2) select the salient details of those events, 3) explain why they are informative, and 4) present the details as manually elicited or automatically shown feedback. We implemented SalienTrack in the context of nutrition tracking. To do this, we first conducted a field study to collect photo-based mobile food tracking over 1-5 weeks. We then report how we used this data to train an explainable-AI model of salience. Finally, we created interfaces to present salient information and conducted a formative user study to gain insights about how SalienTrack could be integrated into an interface for reflection. Our key contributions are the SalienTrack framework, a demonstration of its implementation for semi-automated feedback in an important and challenging self-tracking context and a discussion of the broader uses of the framework.
