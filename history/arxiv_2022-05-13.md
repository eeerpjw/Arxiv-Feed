### MEWS: **Real-time** Social Media Manipulation Detection and Analysis. (arXiv:2205.05783v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Michael Yankoski, Michael Yankoski, Tom Henry, Farah Khashman, Tim Weninger

> ABSTRACT  :  This article presents a beta-version of MEWS (Misinformation Early Warning System). It describes the various aspects of the ingestion, manipulation detection, and graphing algorithms employed to determine--in near real-time--the relationships between social media images as they emerge and spread on social media platforms. By combining these various technologies into a single processing pipeline, MEWS can identify manipulated media items as they arise and identify when these particular items begin trending on individual social media platforms or even across multiple platforms. The emergence of a novel manipulation followed by rapid diffusion of the manipulated content suggests a disinformation campaign.  
### View Synthesis with Sculpted Neural Points. (arXiv:2205.05869v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  We address the task of view synthesis, which can be posed as recovering a rendering function that renders new views from a set of existing images. In many recent works such as **NeRF**, this rendering function is parameterized using **implicit neural representation**s of scene geometry. Implicit neural representations have achieved impressive visual quality but have drawbacks in computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a new approach that performs view synthesis using point clouds. It is the first point-based method to achieve better visual quality than **NeRF** while being more than 100x faster in rendering speed. Our approach builds on existing works on differentiable point-based rendering but introduces a novel technique we call "Sculpted Neural Points (SNP)", which significantly improves the robustness to errors and holes in the reconstructed point cloud. Experiments show that on the task of view synthesis, our sculpting technique closes the gap between point-based and implicit representation-based methods.

> ABSTRACT  :  Blind image quality assessment (BIQA), which aims to accurately predict the image quality without any pristine reference information, has been highly concerned in the past decades. Especially, with the help of deep neural networks, great progress has been achieved so far. However, it remains less investigated on BIQA for **night**-time images (NTIs) which usually suffer from complicated authentic distortions such as reduced visibility, low contrast, additive noises, and color distortions. These diverse authentic degradations particularly challenges the design of effective deep neural network for blind NTI quality evaluation (NTIQE). In this paper, we propose a novel deep decomposition and bilinear pooling network (DDB-Net) to better address this issue. The DDB-Net contains three modules, i.e., an image decomposition module, a feature encoding module, and a bilinear pooling module. The image decomposition module is inspired by the Retinex theory and involves decoupling the input NTI into an illumination layer component responsible for illumination information and a reflectance layer component responsible for content information. Then, the feature encoding module involves learning multi-scale feature representations of degradations that are rooted in the two decoupled components separately. Finally, by modeling illumination-related and content-related degradations as two-factor variations, the two multi-scale feature sets are bilinearly pooled and concatenated together to form a unified representation for quality prediction. The superiority of the proposed DDB-Net is well validated by extensive experiments on two publicly available **night**-time image databases.  
### Dynamic Dense RGB-D SLAM using Learning-based Visual Odometry. (arXiv:2205.05916v1 [cs.RO])
- Authors : Shihao Shen, Yilin Cai, Jiayi Qiu, Guangzhao Li
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05916](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05916)
> ABSTRACT  :  We propose a dense dynamic RGB-D SLAM pipeline based on a learning-based visual odometry, TartanVO. TartanVO, like other direct methods rather than feature-based, estimates camera pose through dense optical flow, which only applies to static scenes and disregards dynamic objects. Due to the **color constancy** assumption, optical flow is not able to differentiate between dynamic and static pixels. Therefore, to reconstruct a static map through such direct methods, our pipeline resolves dynamic/static segmentation by leveraging the optical flow output, and only fuse static points into the map. Moreover, we rerender the input frames such that the dynamic pixels are removed and iteratively pass them back into the visual odometry to refine the pose estimate.  
### Group R-CNN for Weakly Semi-supervised Object Detection with Points. (arXiv:2205.05920v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  We study the problem of weakly semi-supervised object detection with points (WSSOD-P), where the training data is combined by a small set of fully annotated images with bounding boxes and a large set of weakly-labeled images with only a single point annotated for each instance. The core of this task is to train a point-to-box regressor on well-labeled images that can be used to predict credible bounding boxes for each point annotation. We challenge the prior belief that existing CNN-based detectors are not compatible with this task. Based on the classic R-CNN architecture, we propose an effective point-to-box regressor: Group R-CNN. Group R-CNN first uses instance-level proposal grouping to generate a group of proposals for each point annotation and thus can obtain a high recall rate. To better distinguish different instances and improve precision, we propose instance-level proposal assignment to replace the vanilla assignment strategy adopted in the original R-CNN methods. As naive instance-level assignment brings converging difficulty, we propose instance-aware representation learning which consists of instance-aware feature **enhancement** and instance-aware parameter generation to overcome this issue. Comprehensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, Group R-CNN significantly outperforms the prior method Point DETR by 3.9 mAP with 5% well-labeled images, which is the most challenging scenario.

### Ray Priors through Reprojection: Improving Neural Radiance Fields for Novel View Extrapolation. (arXiv:2205.05922v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Jian Zhang, Yuanqing Zhang, Huan Fu, Xiaowei Zhou, Bowen Cai, Jinchi Huang, Rongfei Jia, Binqiang Zhao, Xing Tang
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05922](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05922)
> ABSTRACT  :  Neural Radiance Fields (**NeRF**) have emerged as a potent paradigm for representing scenes and synthesizing photo-realistic images. A main limitation of conventional **NeRF**s is that they often fail to produce high-quality renderings under novel viewpoints that are significantly different from the training viewpoints. In this paper, instead of exploiting few-shot image synthesis, we study the novel view extrapolation setting that (1) the training images can well describe an object, and (2) there is a notable discrepancy between the training and test viewpoints' distributions. We present Rap**NeRF** (RAy Priors) as a solution. Our insight is that the inherent appearances of a 3D surface's arbitrary visible projections should be consistent. We thus propose a random ray casting policy that allows training unseen views using seen views. Furthermore, we show that a ray atlas pre-computed from the observed rays' viewing directions could further enhance the rendering quality for extrapolated views. A main limitation is that Rap**NeRF** would remove the strong view-dependent effects because it leverages the multi-view consistency property.  
### Balancing the Budget: Feature Selection and Tracking for Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Odometry. (arXiv:2109.05975v3 [cs.RO] UPDATED)
- Authors : Lintong Zhang, David Wisth, Marco Camurri, Maurice Fallon
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05975](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05975)
> ABSTRACT  :  We present a multi-camera visual-inertial odometry system based on factor graph optimization which estimates motion by using all cameras simultaneously while retaining a fixed overall feature budget. We focus on motion tracking in challenging environments, such as narrow corridors, **dark** spaces with aggressive motions, and abrupt lighting changes. These scenarios cause traditional monocular or stereo odometry to fail. While tracking motion with extra cameras should theoretically prevent failures, it leads to additional complexity and computational burden. To overcome these challenges, we introduce two novel methods to improve multi-camera feature tracking. First, instead of tracking features separately in each camera, we track features continuously as they move from one camera to another. This increases accuracy and achieves a more compact factor graph representation. Second, we select a fixed budget of tracked features across the cameras to reduce back-end optimization time. We have found that using a smaller set of informative features can maintain the same tracking accuracy. Our proposed method was extensively tested using a hardware-synchronized device consisting of an IMU and four cameras (a front stereo pair and two lateral) in scenarios including: an underground mine, large open spaces, and building interiors with narrow stairs and corridors. Compared to stereo-only state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry methods, our approach reduces the drift rate, relative pose error, by up to 80% in translation and 39% in rotation.

### Ensemble Clustering via Co-association Matrix Self-**enhancement**. (arXiv:2205.05937v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Yuheng Jia, Sirui Tao, Ran Wang, Yongheng Wang
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05937](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05937)
> ABSTRACT  :  Ensemble clustering integrates a set of base clustering results to generate a stronger one. Existing methods usually rely on a co-association (CA) matrix that measures how many times two samples are grouped into the same cluster according to the base clusterings to achieve ensemble clustering. However, when the constructed CA matrix is of low quality, the performance will degrade. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective CA matrix self-**enhancement** framework that can improve the CA matrix to achieve better clustering performance. Specifically, we first extract the high-confidence (HC) information from the base clusterings to form a sparse HC matrix. By propagating the highly-reliable information of the HC matrix to the CA matrix and complementing the HC matrix according to the CA matrix simultaneously, the proposed method generates an enhanced CA matrix for better clustering. Technically, the proposed model is formulated as a symmetric constrained convex optimization problem, which is efficiently solved by an alternating iterative algorithm with convergence and global optimum theoretically guaranteed. Extensive experimental comparisons with twelve state-of-the-art methods on eight benchmark datasets substantiate the effectiveness, flexibility and efficiency of the proposed model in ensemble clustering.

### NFLAT: Non-Flat-Lattice Transformer for Chinese Named Entity Recognition. (arXiv:2205.05832v1 [cs.CL])
- Authors : Shuang Wu, Xiaoning Song, Zhenhua Feng, Xiaojun Wu
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05832](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05832)
> ABSTRACT  :  Recently, FLAT has achieved great success in Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER). This method achieves lexical **enhancement** by constructing a flat lattice, which mitigates the difficulties posed by blurred word boundaries and the lack of word semantics. To this end, FLAT uses the position information of the starting and ending characters to connect the matching words. However, this method is likely to match more words when dealing with long texts, resulting in very long input sequences. Therefore, it increases the memory used by self-attention and computational costs. To deal with this issue, we advocate a novel lexical **enhancement** method, InterFormer, that effectively reduces the amount of computational and memory costs by constructing the non-flat-lattice. Furthermore, we implement a complete model, namely NFLAT, for the Chinese NER task. NFLAT decouples lexicon fusion and context feature encoding. Compared with FLAT, it reduces unnecessary attention calculations in "word-character" and "word-word". This reduces the memory usage by about 50\% and can use more extensive lexicons or higher batches for network training. The experimental results obtained on several well-known benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art character-word hybrid models.
