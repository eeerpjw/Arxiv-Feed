> ABSTRACT  :  Steganalysis as a method to detect whether image contains se-cret message, is a crucial study avoiding the imperils from abus-ing steganography. The point of steganalysis is to detect the weak embedding signals which is hardly learned by convolution-al layer and easily suppressed. In this paper, to enhance embed-ding signals, we study the insufficiencies of activation function, filters and loss function from the aspects of reduce embedding signal loss and enhance embedding signal capture ability. Adap-tive Parametric Activation Module is designed to reserve nega-tive embedding signal. For embedding signal capture ability **enhancement**, we add constraints on the high-pass filters to im-prove residual diversity which enables the filters extracts rich embedding signals. Besides, a loss function based on contrastive learning is applied to overcome the limitations of cross-entropy loss by maximum inter-class distance. It helps the network make a distinction between embedding signals and semantic edges. We use images from BOSSbase 1.01 and make stegos by WOW and S-UNIWARD for experiments. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our method has a competitive performance.

> ABSTRACT  :  Recently, a surge of interest in visual transformers is to reduce the computational cost by limiting the calculation of self-attention to a local window. Most current work uses a fixed single-scale window for modeling by default, ignoring the impact of window size on model performance. However, this may limit the modeling potential of these window-based models for multi-scale information. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Dynamic Window Vision Transformer (DW-ViT). The dynamic window strategy proposed by DW-ViT goes beyond the model that employs a fixed single window setting. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use dynamic multi-scale windows to explore the upper limit of the effect of window settings on model performance. In DW-ViT, multi-scale information is obtained by assigning windows of different sizes to different head groups of window multi-head self-attention. Then, the information is dynamically fused by assigning different weights to the multi-scale window branches. We conducted a detailed performance evaluation on three datasets, ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, and COCO. Compared with related state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods, DW-ViT obtains the best performance. Specifically, compared with the current SoTA **Swin** Transformers \cite{liu2021swin}, DW-ViT has achieved consistent and substantial improvements on all three datasets with similar parameters and computational costs. In addition, DW-ViT exhibits good scalability and can be easily inserted into any window-based visual transformers.  
### FAMLP: A Frequency-Aware MLP-Like Architecture For Domain Generalization. (arXiv:2203.12893v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  MLP-like models built entirely upon multi-layer perceptrons have recently been revisited, exhibiting the comparable performance with transformers. It is one of most promising architectures due to the excellent trade-off between network capability and efficiency in the large-scale recognition tasks. However, its generalization performance to heterogeneous tasks is inferior to other architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers) due to the extensive retention of domain information. To address this problem, we propose a novel frequency-aware MLP architecture, in which the domain-specific features are filtered out in the transformed frequency domain, augmenting the invariant descriptor for label prediction. Specifically, we design an adaptive Fourier filter layer, in which a learnable frequency filter is utilized to adjust the amplitude distribution by optimizing both the real and imaginary parts. A low-rank **enhancement** module is further proposed to rectify the filtered features by adding the low-frequency components from SVD decomposition. Finally, a momentum update strategy is utilized to stabilize the optimization to fluctuation of model parameters and inputs by the output distillation with weighted historical states. To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose a MLP-like backbone for domain generalization. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate significant generalization performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3%, 4% and 9%, respectively.  
### A Preliminary Research on Space Situational Awareness Based on Event Cameras. (arXiv:2203.13093v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Event camera is a new type of sensor that is different from traditional cameras. Each pixel is triggered asynchronously by an event. The trigger event is the change of the brightness irradiated on the pixel. If the increment or decrement is higher than a certain threshold, the event is output. Compared with traditional cameras, event cameras have the advantages of high temporal resolution, low latency, **high dynamic range**, low bandwidth and low power consumption. We carried out a series of observation experiments in a simulated space lighting environment. The experimental results show that the event camera can give full play to the above advantages in space situational awareness. This article first introduces the basic principles of the event camera, then analyzes its advantages and disadvantages, then introduces the observation experiment and analyzes the experimental results, and finally, a workflow of space situational awareness based on event cameras is given.  
### Physics-based Learning of Parameterized Thermodynamics from **Real-time** Thermography. (arXiv:2203.13148v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Progress in automatic control of thermal processes has long been limited by the difficulty of obtaining high-fidelity thermodynamic models. Traditionally, in complex thermodynamic systems, it is often infeasible to estimate the thermophysical parameters of spatiotemporally varying processes, forcing the adoption of model-free control architectures. This comes at the cost of losing any robustness guarantees, and implies a need for extensive real-life testing. In recent years, however, infrared cameras and other thermographic equipment have become readily applicable to these processes, allowing for a real-time, non-invasive means of sensing the thermal state of a process. In this work, we present a novel physics-based approach to learning a thermal process's dynamics directly from such real-time thermographic data, while focusing attention on regions with high thermal activity. We call this process, which applies to any higher-dimensional scalar field, attention-based noise robust averaging (ANRA). Given a partial-differential equation model structure, we show that our approach is robust against noise, and can be used to initialize optimization routines to further refine parameter estimates. We demonstrate our method on several simulation examples, as well as by applying it to electrosurgical thermal response data on in vivo porcine skin tissue.

> ABSTRACT  :  State-of-the-art transformer-based video instance segmentation (VIS) approaches typically utilize either single-scale spatio-temporal features or per-frame multi-scale features during the attention computations. We argue that such an attention computation ignores the multi-scale spatio-temporal feature relationships that are crucial to tackle target appearance deformations in videos. To address this issue, we propose a transformer-based VIS framework, named MS-STS VIS, that comprises a novel multi-scale spatio-temporal split (MS-STS) attention module in the encoder. The proposed MS-STS module effectively captures spatio-temporal feature relationships at multiple scales across frames in a video. We further introduce an attention block in the decoder to enhance the temporal consistency of the detected instances in different frames of a video. Moreover, an auxiliary discriminator is introduced during training to ensure better foreground-background separability within the multi-scale spatio-temporal feature space. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmarks: Youtube-VIS (2019 and 2021). Our MS-STS VIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both benchmarks. When using the ResNet50 backbone, our MS-STS achieves a mask AP of 50.1 %, outperforming the best reported results in literature by 2.7 % and by 4.8 % at higher overlap threshold of AP_75, while being comparable in model size and speed on Youtube-VIS 2019 val. set. When using the **Swin** Transformer backbone, MS-STS VIS achieves mask AP of 61.0 % on Youtube-VIS 2019 val. set. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/OmkarThawakar/MSSTS-VIS.  
### Unpaired Deep Image Deraining Using Dual Contrastive Learning. (arXiv:2109.02973v4 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Learning single image deraining (SID) networks from an unpaired set of clean and rainy images is practical and valuable as acquiring paired real-world data is almost infeasible. However, without the paired data as the supervision, learning a SID network is challenging. Moreover, simply using existing unpaired learning methods (e.g., unpaired adversarial learning and cycle-consistency constraints) in the SID task is insufficient to learn the underlying relationship from rainy inputs to clean outputs as there exists significant domain gap between the rainy and clean images. In this paper, we develop an effective unpaired SID adversarial framework which explores mutual properties of the unpaired exemplars by a dual contrastive learning manner in a deep feature space, named as DCD-GAN. The proposed method mainly consists of two cooperative branches: Bidirectional Translation Branch (BTB) and Contrastive Guidance Branch (CGB). Specifically, BTB exploits full advantage of the circulatory architecture of adversarial consistency to generate abundant exemplar pairs and excavates latent feature distributions between two domains by equipping it with bidirectional mapping. Simultaneously, CGB implicitly constrains the embeddings of different exemplars in the deep feature space by encouraging the similar feature distributions closer while pushing the dissimilar further away, in order to better facilitate rain removal and help image **restoration**. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably against existing unpaired deraining approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and generates comparable results against several fully-supervised or semi-supervised models.  
### Pixel-wise Energy-biased Abstention Learning for Anomaly Segmentation on Complex Urban Driving Scenes. (arXiv:2111.12264v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  State-of-the-art (SOTA) anomaly segmentation approaches on complex urban driving scenes explore pixel-wise classification uncertainty learned from outlier **exposure**, or external reconstruction models. However, previous uncertainty approaches that directly associate high uncertainty to anomaly may sometimes lead to incorrect anomaly predictions, and external reconstruction models tend to be too inefficient for real-time self-driving embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly segmentation method, named pixel-wise energy-biased abstention learning (PEBAL), that explores pixel-wise abstention learning (AL) with a model that learns an adaptive pixel-level anomaly class, and an energy-based model (EBM) that learns inlier pixel distribution. More specifically, PEBAL is based on a non-trivial joint training of EBM and AL, where EBM is trained to output high-energy for anomaly pixels (from outlier **exposure**) and AL is trained such that these high-energy pixels receive adaptive low penalty for being included to the anomaly class. We extensively evaluate PEBAL against the SOTA and show that it achieves the best performance across four benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/tianyu0207/PEBAL.

> ABSTRACT  :  Domain Adaptation (DA) has recently raised strong interests in the medical imaging community. While a large variety of DA techniques has been proposed for image segmentation, most of these techniques have been validated either on private datasets or on small publicly available datasets. Moreover, these datasets mostly addressed single-class problems. To tackle these limitations, the Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge was organised in conjunction with the 24th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2021). CrossMoDA is the first large and multi-class benchmark for unsupervised cross-modality DA. The challenge's goal is to segment two key brain structures involved in the follow-up and treatment planning of vestibular schwannoma (VS): the VS and the cochleas. Currently, the diagnosis and surveillance in patients with VS are performed using contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) MRI. However, there is growing interest in using non-contrast sequences such as high-resolution T2 (hrT2) MRI. Therefore, we created an unsupervised cross-modality segmentation benchmark. The training set provides annotated ceT1 (N=105) and unpaired non-annotated hrT2 (N=105). The aim was to automatically perform unilateral VS and **bilateral** cochlea segmentation on hrT2 as provided in the testing set (N=137). A total of 16 teams submitted their algorithm for the evaluation phase. The level of performance reached by the top-performing teams is strikingly high (best median Dice - VS:88.4%; Cochleas:85.7%) and close to full supervision (median Dice - VS:92.5%; Cochleas:87.7%). All top-performing methods made use of an image-to-image translation approach to transform the source-domain images into pseudo-target-domain images. A segmentation network was then trained using these generated images and the manual annotations provided for the source image.  
### Joint Feature Learning and Relation Modeling for Tracking: A One-Stream Framework. (arXiv:2203.11991v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  The current popular two-stream, two-stage tracking framework extracts the template and the search region features separately and then performs relation modeling, thus the extracted features lack the awareness of the target and have limited target-background discriminability. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel one-stream tracking (OSTrack) framework that unifies feature learning and relation modeling by bridging the template-search image pairs with bidirectional information flows. In this way, discriminative target-oriented features can be dynamically extracted by mutual guidance. Since no extra heavy relation modeling module is needed and the implementation is highly parallelized, the proposed tracker runs at a fast speed. To further improve the inference efficiency, an in-network candidate early elimination module is proposed based on the strong similarity prior calculated in the one-stream framework. As a unified framework, OSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, in particular, it shows impressive results on the one-shot tracking benchmark GOT-10k, i.e., achieving 73.7% AO, improving the existing best result (**Swin**Track) by 4.3%. Besides, our method maintains a good performance-speed trade-off and shows faster convergence. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/botaoye/OSTrack.

### HiFi++: a Unified Framework for Neural Vocoding, Bandwidth Extension and Speech **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2203.13086v1 [cs.SD])

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13086](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13086)
> ABSTRACT  :  Generative adversarial networks have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in neural vocoding outperforming best autoregressive and flow-based models. In this paper, we show that this success can be extended to other tasks of conditional audio generation. In particular, building upon HiFi vocoders, we propose a novel HiFi++ general framework for neural vocoding, bandwidth extension, and speech **enhancement**. We show that with the improved generator architecture and simplified multi-discriminator training, HiFi++ performs on par with the state-of-the-art in these tasks while spending significantly less memory and computational resources. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through a series of extensive experiments.  
### Back2Future: Leveraging Backfill Dynamics for Improving **Real-time** Predictions in Future. (arXiv:2106.04420v7 [cs.LG] UPDATED)
- Authors : Harshavardhan Kamarthi, Alexander Rodr, Aditya Prakash

> ABSTRACT  :  In real-time forecasting in public health, data collection is a non-trivial and demanding task. Often after initially released, it undergoes several revisions later (maybe due to human or technical constraints) - as a result, it may take weeks until the data reaches to a stable value. This so-called 'backfill' phenomenon and its effect on model performance has been barely studied in the prior literature. In this paper, we introduce the multi-variate backfill problem using COVID-19 as the motivating example. We construct a detailed dataset composed of relevant signals over the past year of the pandemic. We then systematically characterize several patterns in backfill dynamics and leverage our observations for formulating a novel problem and neural framework Back2Future that aims to refines a given model's predictions in real-time. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method refines the performance of top models for COVID-19 forecasting, in contrast to non-trivial baselines, yielding 18% improvement over baselines, enabling us obtain a new SOTA performance. In addition, we show that our model improves model evaluation too; hence policy-makers can better understand the true accuracy of forecasting models in real-time.  
### MetricGAN+/-: Increasing Robustness of Noise Reduction on Unseen Data. (arXiv:2203.12369v2 [cs.SD] UPDATED)
- Authors : George Close, Thomas Hain, Stefan Goetze
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12369](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12369)
> ABSTRACT  :  Training of speech **enhancement** systems often does not incorporate knowledge of human perception and thus can lead to unnatural sounding results. Incorporating psychoacoustically motivated speech perception metrics as part of model training via a predictor network has recently gained interest. However, the performance of such predictors is limited by the distribution of metric scores that appear in the training data. In this work, we propose MetricGAN+/- (an extension of MetricGAN+, one such metric-motivated system) which introduces an additional network - a "de-generator" which attempts to improve the robustness of the prediction network (and by extension of the generator) by ensuring observation of a wider range of metric scores in training. Experimental results on the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset show relative improvement in PESQ score of 3.8% (3.05 vs 3.22 PESQ score), as well as better generalisation to unseen noise and speech.
