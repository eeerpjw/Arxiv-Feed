> ABSTRACT  :  Infrared (IR) images are widely used in many fields such as medical imaging, object tracking, astronomy and military purposes for securing borders. Infrared images can be captured day or **night** based on the type of capturing device. The capturing devices use electromagnetic radiation with longer wavelengths. There are several types of IR radiation based on the range of wavelength and corresponding frequency. Due to noising and other artifacts, IR images are not clearly visible. In this paper, we present a complete up-todate survey on IR imaging **enhancement** techniques. The survey includes IR radiation types and devices and existing IR datasets. The survey covers spatial **enhancement** techniques, frequency-domain based **enhancement** techniques and Deep learning-based techniques.

> ABSTRACT  :  The recent introduction of portable, low-field MRI (LF-MRI) into the clinical setting has the potential to transform neuroimaging. However, LF-MRI is limited by lower resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, leading to incomplete characterization of brain regions. To address this challenge, recent advances in machine learning facilitate the synthesis of higher resolution images derived from one or multiple lower resolution scans. Here, we report the extension of a machine learning super-resolution (SR) algorithm to synthesize 1 mm isotropic MPRAGE-like scans from LF-MRI T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences. Our initial results on a paired dataset of LF and high-field (HF, 1.5T-3T) clinical scans show that: (i) application of available automated segmentation tools directly to LF-MRI images falters; but (ii) segmentation tools succeed when applied to SR images with high correlation to gold standard measurements from HF-MRI (e.g., r = 0.85 for hippocampal volume, r = 0.84 for the thalamus, r = 0.92 for the whole cerebrum). This work demonstrates proof-of-principle post-processing image **enhancement** from lower resolution LF-MRI sequences. These results lay the foundation for future work to enhance the detection of normal and abnormal image findings at LF and ultimately improve the diagnostic performance of LF-MRI. Our tools are publicly available on FreeSurfer (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/).

> ABSTRACT  :  Phase-Stretch Adaptive Gradient-Field Extractor (PAGE) is an edge detection algorithm that is inspired by physics of electromagnetic diffraction and dispersion. A computational imaging algorithm, it identifies edges, their orientations and sharpness in a digital image where the image brightness changes abruptly. Edge detection is a basic operation performed by the eye and is crucial to visual perception. PAGE embeds an original image into a set of feature maps that can be used for object representation and classification. The algorithm performs exceptionally well as an edge and texture extractor in **low light** level and low contrast images. This manuscript is prepared to support the open-source code which is being simultaneously made available within the GitHub repository https://github.com/JalaliLabUCLA.

> ABSTRACT  :  Low-dose dental cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been increasingly used for maxillofacial modeling. However, the presence of metallic inserts, such as implants, crowns, and dental filling, causes severe streaking and shading artifacts in a CBCT image and loss of the morphological structures of the teeth, which consequently prevents accurate segmentation of bones. A two-stage metal artifact reduction method is proposed for accurate 3D low-dose maxillofacial CBCT modeling, where a key idea is to utilize explicit tooth shape prior information from intra-oral scan data whose acquisition does not require any extra radiation **exposure**. In the first stage, an image-to-image deep learning network is employed to mitigate metal-related artifacts. To improve the learning ability, the proposed network is designed to take advantage of the intra-oral scan data as side-inputs and perform multi-task learning of auxiliary tooth segmentation. In the second stage, a 3D maxillofacial model is constructed by segmenting the bones from the dental CBCT image corrected in the first stage. For accurate bone segmentation, weighted thresholding is applied, wherein the weighting region is determined depending on the geometry of the intra-oral scan data. Because acquiring a paired training dataset of metal-artifact-free and metal artifact-affected dental CBCT images is challenging in clinical practice, an automatic method of generating a realistic dataset according to the CBCT physics model is introduced. Numerical simulations and clinical experiments show the feasibility of the proposed method, which takes advantage of tooth surface information from intra-oral scan data in 3D low dose maxillofacial CBCT modeling.  
### Fair SA: Sensitivity Analysis for Fairness in Face Recognition. (arXiv:2202.03586v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  As the use of deep learning in high impact domains becomes ubiquitous, it is increasingly important to assess the resilience of models. One such high impact domain is that of face recognition, with real world applications involving images affected by various degradations, such as motion blur or high **exposure**. Moreover, images captured across different attributes, such as gender and race, can also challenge the robustness of a face recognition algorithm. While traditional summary statistics suggest that the aggregate performance of face recognition models has continued to improve, these metrics do not directly measure the robustness or fairness of the models. Visual Psychophysics Sensitivity Analysis (VPSA) [1] provides a way to pinpoint the individual causes of failure by way of introducing incremental perturbations in the data. However, perturbations may affect subgroups differently. In this paper, we propose a new fairness evaluation based on robustness in the form of a generic framework that extends VPSA. With this framework, we can analyze the ability of a model to perform fairly for different subgroups of a population affected by perturbations, and pinpoint the exact failure modes for a subgroup by measuring targeted robustness. With the increasing focus on the fairness of models, we use face recognition as an example application of our framework and propose to compactly visualize the fairness analysis of a model via AUC matrices. We analyze the performance of common face recognition models and empirically show that certain subgroups are at a disadvantage when images are perturbed, thereby uncovering trends that were not visible using the model's performance on subgroups without perturbations.

> ABSTRACT  :  Edge computing and 5G have made it possible to perform analytics closer to the source of data and achieve super-low latency response times, which is not possible with centralized cloud deployment. In this paper, we present a novel fever-screening system, which uses edge machine learning techniques and leverages private 5G to accurately identify and screen individuals with fever in real-time. Particularly, we present deep-learning based novel techniques for fusion and alignment of cross-spectral visual and thermal data streams at the edge. Our novel Cross-Spectral Generative Adversarial Network (CS-GAN) synthesizes visual images that have the key, representative object level features required to uniquely associate objects across visual and thermal spectrum. Two key features of CS-GAN are a novel, feature-preserving loss function that results in high-quality pairing of corresponding cross-spectral objects, and dual bottleneck residual layers with skip connections (a new, network **enhancement**) to not only accelerate real-time inference, but to also speed up convergence during model training at the edge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first technique that leverages 5G networks and limited edge resources to enable real-time feature-level association of objects in visual and thermal streams (30 ms per full HD frame on an Intel Core i7-8650 4-core, 1.9GHz mobile processor). To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first system to achieve real-time operation, which has enabled fever screening of employees and guests in arenas, theme parks, airports and other critical facilities. By leveraging edge computing and 5G, our fever screening system is able to achieve 98.5% accuracy and is able to process about 5X more people when compared to a centralized cloud deployment.

> ABSTRACT  :  In this work, we address an important problem of optical see through (OST) augmented reality: non-negative image synthesis. Most of the image generation methods fail under this condition, since they assume full control over each pixel and cannot create **dark**er pixels by adding light. In order to solve the non-negative image generation problem in AR image synthesis, prior works have attempted to utilize optical illusion to simulate human vision but fail to preserve lightness constancy well under situations such as **high dynamic range**. In our paper, we instead propose a method that is able to preserve lightness constancy at a local level, thus capturing high frequency details. Compared with existing work, our method shows strong performance in image-to-image translation tasks, particularly in scenarios such as large scale images, high resolution images, and **high dynamic range** image transfer.  
### DAB-DETR: Dynamic Anchor Boxes are Better Queries for DETR. (arXiv:2201.12329v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  We present in this paper a novel query formulation using dynamic anchor boxes for DETR (DEtection TRansformer) and offer a deeper understanding of the role of queries in DETR. This new formulation directly uses box coordinates as queries in Transformer decoders and dynamically updates them layer-by-layer. Using box coordinates not only helps using explicit positional priors to improve the query-to-feature similarity and eliminate the slow training convergence issue in DETR, but also allows us to modulate the positional attention map using the box width and height information. Such a design makes it clear that queries in DETR can be implemented as performing soft ROI pooling layer-by-layer in a cascade manner. As a result, it leads to the best performance on MS-COCO benchmark among the DETR-like detection models under the same setting, e.g., AP 45.7\% using ResNet50-DC5 as backbone trained in 50 epochs. We also conducted extensive experiments to confirm our analysis and verify the effectiveness of our methods. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/SlongLiu/DAB-DETR}.

> ABSTRACT  :  With 3.78 billion social media users worldwide in 2021 (48% of the human population), almost 3 billion images are shared daily. At the same time, a consistent evolution of smartphone cameras has led to a photography explosion with 85% of all new pictures being captured using smartphones. However, lately, there has been an increased discussion of privacy concerns when a person being photographed is unaware of the picture being taken or has reservations about the same being shared. These privacy violations are amplified for people with disabilities, who may find it challenging to raise dissent even if they are aware. Such unauthorized image captures may also be misused to gain sympathy by third-party organizations, leading to a privacy breach. Privacy for people with disabilities has so far received comparatively less attention from the AI community. This motivates us to work towards a solution to generate privacy-conscious cues for raising awareness in smartphone users of any sensitivity in their viewfinder content. To this end, we introduce PrivPAS (A **real time** Privacy-Preserving AI System) a novel framework to identify sensitive content. Additionally, we curate and annotate a dataset to identify and localize accessibility markers and classify whether an image is sensitive to a featured subject with a disability. We demonstrate that the proposed lightweight architecture, with a memory footprint of a mere 8.49MB, achieves a high mAP of 89.52% on resource-constrained devices. Furthermore, our pipeline, trained on face anonymized data, achieves an F1-score of 73.1%.

> ABSTRACT  :  Over the past decades, the development of CT technologies has been largely driven by the needs for cardiac imaging but the temporal resolution remains insufficient for clinical CT in difficult cases and rather challenging for preclinical micro-CT since small animals, as human cardiac disease models, have much higher heart rates than human. To address this challenge, here we report a Stationary Multi-source AI-based **Real-time** Tomography (SMART) micro-CT system. This unique scanner is featured by 29 source-detector pairs fixed on a circular track to collect x-ray signals in parallel, enabling instantaneous tomography in principle. Given the multi-source architecture, the field-of-view only covers a cardiac region. To solve this interior problem, an AI-empowered interior tomography approach is developed to synergize sparsity-based regularization and learning-based reconstruction. To demonstrate the performance and utilities of the SMART system, extensive results are obtained in physical phantom experiments and animal studies, including dead and live rats as well as live rabbits. The reconstructed volumetric images convincingly demonstrate the merits of the SMART system using the AI-empowered interior tomography approach, enabling cardiac micro-CT with the unprecedented temporal resolution of 30ms, which is an order of magnitude higher than the state of the art.

> ABSTRACT  :  Jet tagging is a critical yet challenging classification task in particle physics. While deep learning has transformed jet tagging and significantly improved performance, the lack of a large-scale public dataset impedes further **enhancement**. In this work, we present JetClass, a new comprehensive dataset for jet tagging. The JetClass dataset consists of 100 M jets, about two orders of magnitude larger than existing public datasets. A total of 10 types of jets are simulated, including several types unexplored for tagging so far. Based on the large dataset, we propose a new Transformer-based architecture for jet tagging, called Particle Transformer (ParT). By incorporating pairwise particle interactions in the attention mechanism, ParT achieves higher tagging performance than a plain Transformer and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art, ParticleNet, by a large margin. The pre-trained ParT models, once fine-tuned, also substantially enhance the performance on two widely adopted jet tagging benchmarks.

> ABSTRACT  :  Motorsport has always been an enabler for technological advancement, and the same applies to the autonomous driving industry. The team TUM Auton-omous Motorsports will participate in the Indy Autonomous Challenge in Octo-ber 2021 to benchmark its self-driving software-stack by racing one out of ten autonomous Dallara AV-21 racecars at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The first part of this paper explains the reasons for entering an autonomous vehicle race from an academic perspective: It allows focusing on several edge cases en-countered by autonomous vehicles, such as challenging evasion maneuvers and unstructured scenarios. At the same time, it is inherently safe due to the motor-sport related track safety precautions. It is therefore an ideal testing ground for the development of autonomous driving algorithms capable of mastering the most challenging and rare situations. In addition, we provide insight into our soft-ware development workflow and present our Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation setup. It is capable of running simulations of up to eight autonomous vehicles in **real time**. The second part of the paper gives a high-level overview of the soft-ware architecture and covers our development priorities in building a high-per-formance autonomous racing software: maximum sensor detection range, relia-ble handling of multi-vehicle situations, as well as reliable motion control under uncertainty.  
### Research on Event Accumulator Settings for Event-Based SLAM. (arXiv:2112.00427v4 [cs.RO] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Event cameras are a new type of sensors that are different from traditional cameras. Each pixel is triggered asynchronously by event. The trigger event is the change of the brightness irradiated on the pixel. If the increment or decrement of brightness is higher than a certain threshold, an event is output. Compared with traditional cameras, event cameras have the advantages of **high dynamic range** and no motion blur. Accumulating events to frames and using traditional SLAM algorithm is a direct and efficient way for event-based SLAM. Different event accumulator settings, such as slice method of event stream, processing method for no motion, using polarity or not, decay function and event contribution, can cause quite different accumulating results. We conducted the research on how to accumulate event frames to achieve a better event-based SLAM performance. For experiment verification, accumulated event frames are fed to the traditional SLAM system to construct an event-based SLAM system. Our strategy of setting event accumulator has been evaluated on the public dataset. The experiment results show that our method can achieve better performance in most sequences compared with the state-of-the-art event frame based SLAM algorithm. In addition, the proposed approach has been tested on a quadrotor UAV to show the potential of applications in real scenario. Code and results are open sourced to benefit the research community of event cameras.
