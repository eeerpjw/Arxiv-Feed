> ABSTRACT  :  The success of Transformer in computer vision has attracted increasing attention in the medical imaging community. Especially for medical image segmentation, many excellent hybrid architectures based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer have been presented and achieve impressive performance. However, most of these methods, which embed modular Transformer into CNNs, struggle to reach their full potential. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture for medical image segmentation called PHTrans, which parallelly hybridizes Transformer and CNN in main building blocks to produce hierarchical representations from global and local features and adaptively aggregate them, aiming to fully exploit their strengths to obtain better segmentation performance. Specifically, PHTrans follows the U-shaped encoder-decoder design and introduces the parallel hybird module in deep stages, where convolution blocks and the modified 3D **Swin** Transformer learn local features and global dependencies separately, then a sequence-to-volume operation unifies the dimensions of the outputs to achieve feature aggregation. Extensive experimental results on both Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault and Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challeng datasets corroborate its effectiveness, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

> ABSTRACT  :  In this work, we propose Text-Degradation Invariant Auto Encoder (Text-DIAE) aimed to solve two tasks, text recognition (handwritten or scene-text) and document image **enhancement**. We define three pretext tasks as learning objectives to be optimized during pre-training without the usage of labelled data. Each of the pre-text objectives is specifically tailored for the final downstream tasks. We conduct several ablation experiments that show the importance of each degradation for a specific domain. Exhaustive experimentation shows that our method does not have limitations of previous state-of-the-art based on contrastive losses while at the same time requiring essentially fewer data samples to converge. Finally, we demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art significantly in existing supervised and self-supervised settings in handwritten and scene text recognition and document image **enhancement**. Our code and trained models will be made publicly available at~\url{ <a href="http://Upon_Acceptance">this http URL</a>}.

> ABSTRACT  :  Image acquisition in **low-light** conditions suffers from poor quality and significant degradation in visual aesthetics. This affects the visual perception of the acquired image and the performance of various computer vision and image processing algorithms applied after acquisition. Especially for videos, the additional temporal domain makes it more challenging, wherein we need to preserve quality in a temporally coherent manner. We present a simple yet effective approach for **low-light** image and video **enhancement**. To this end, we introduce "Adaptive Chromaticity", which refers to an adaptive computation of image chromaticity. The above adaptivity allows us to avoid the costly step of **low-light** image decomposition into illumination and reflectance, employed by many existing techniques. All stages in our method consist of only point-based operations and high-pass or low-pass filtering, thereby ensuring that the amount of temporal incoherence is negligible when applied on a per-frame basis for videos. Our results on standard lowlight image datasets show the efficacy of our algorithm and its qualitative and quantitative superiority over several state-of-the-art techniques. For videos captured in the wild, we perform a user study to demonstrate the preference for our method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.  
### Image-Adaptive YOLO for Object Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions. (arXiv:2112.08088v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Though deep learning-based object detection methods have achieved promising results on the conventional datasets, it is still challenging to locate objects from the low-quality images captured in adverse weather conditions. The existing methods either have difficulties in balancing the tasks of image **enhancement** and object detection, or often ignore the latent information beneficial for detection. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Image-Adaptive YOLO (IA-YOLO) framework, where each image can be adaptively enhanced for better detection performance. Specifically, a differentiable image processing (DIP) module is presented to take into account the adverse weather conditions for YOLO detector, whose parameters are predicted by a small convolutional neural net-work (CNN-PP). We learn CNN-PP and YOLOv3 jointly in an end-to-end fashion, which ensures that CNN-PP can learn an appropriate DIP to enhance the image for detection in a weakly supervised manner. Our proposed IA-YOLO approach can adaptively process images in both normal and adverse weather conditions. The experimental results are very encouraging, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed IA-YOLO method in both foggy and **low-light** scenarios.

> ABSTRACT  :  In the coming years and decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs) will become increasingly prevalent, offering new opportunities for safer and more convenient travel and potentially smarter traffic control methods exploiting automation and connectivity. Car following is a prime function in autonomous driving. Car following based on reinforcement learning has received attention in recent years with the goal of learning and achieving performance levels comparable to humans. However, most existing RL methods model car following as a unilateral problem, sensing only the vehicle ahead. Recent literature, however, Wang and Horn [16] has shown that **bilateral** car following that considers the vehicle ahead and the vehicle behind exhibits better system stability. In this paper we hypothesize that this **bilateral** car following can be learned using RL, while learning other goals such as efficiency maximisation, jerk minimization, and safety rewards leading to a learned model that outperforms human driving.    We propose and introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for car following control by integrating **bilateral** information into both state and reward function based on the **bilateral** control model (BCM) for car following control. Furthermore, we use a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to generate the corresponding control action for each agent. Our simulation results demonstrate that our learned policy is better than the human driving policy in terms of (a) inter-vehicle headways, (b) average speed, (c) jerk, (d) Time to Collision (TTC) and (e) string stability.  
### Leveraging Online Shopping Behaviors as a Proxy for Personal Lifestyle Choices: New Insights into Chronic Disease Prevention Literacy. (arXiv:2104.14281v5 [cs.CY] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Objective Ubiquitous internet access is reshaping the way we live, but it is accompanied by unprecedented challenges in preventing chronic diseases that are usually planted by long **exposure** to unhealthy lifestyles. This paper proposes leveraging online shopping behaviors as a proxy for personal lifestyle choices to improve chronic disease prevention literacy, targeted for times when e-commerce user experience has been assimilated into most people's everyday lives.    Methods: Longitudinal query logs and purchase records from 15 million online shoppers were accessed, constructing a broad spectrum of lifestyle features covering various product categories and buyer personas. Using the lifestyle-related information preceding online shoppers' first purchases of specific prescription drugs, we could determine associations between their past lifestyle choices and whether they suffered from a particular chronic disease.    Results: Novel lifestyle risk factors were discovered in two exemplars--depression and type 2 diabetes, most of which showed reasonable consistency with existing healthcare knowledge. Further, such empirical findings could be adopted to locate online shoppers at higher risk of these chronic diseases with decent accuracy [i.e., (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) AUC=0.68 for depression and AUC=0.70 for type 2 diabetes], closely matching the performance of screening surveys benchmarked against medical diagnosis.    Conclusions: Mining online shopping behaviors can point medical experts to a series of lifestyle issues associated with chronic diseases that are less explored to date. Hopefully, unobtrusive chronic disease surveillance via e-commerce sites can grant consenting individuals a privilege to be connected more readily with the medical profession and sophistication.  
### Mixture Outlier **Exposure**: Towards Out-of-Distribution Detection in Fine-grained Environments. (arXiv:2106.03917v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Many real-world scenarios in which DNN-based recognition systems are deployed have inherently fine-grained attributes (e.g., bird-species recognition, medical image classification). In addition to achieving reliable accuracy, a critical subtask for these models is to detect Out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Given the nature of the deployment environment, one may expect such OOD inputs to also be fine-grained w.r.t. the known classes (e.g., a novel bird species), which are thus extremely difficult to identify. Unfortunately, OOD detection in fine-grained scenarios remains largely underexplored. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by first carefully constructing four large-scale fine-grained test environments, in which existing methods are shown to have difficulties. Particularly, we find that even explicitly incorporating a diverse set of auxiliary outlier data during training does not provide sufficient coverage over the broad region where fine-grained OOD samples locate. We then propose Mixture Outlier **Exposure** (MixOE), which mixes ID data and training outliers to expand the coverage of different OOD granularities, and trains the model such that the prediction confidence linearly decays as the input transitions from ID to OOD. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of MixOE for building up OOD detector in fine-grained environments. Code is available at https://github.com/zjysteven/MixOE.  
### Rank-Regret Minimization. (arXiv:2111.08563v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Multi-criteria decision-making often requires finding a small representative set from the database. A recently proposed method is the regret minimization set (RMS) query. RMS returns a size $r$ subset $S$ of dataset $D$ that minimizes the regret-ratio (the difference between the score of top-1 in $S$ and the score of top-1 in $D$, for any possible utility function). RMS is not shift invariant, causing inconsistency in results. Further, existing work showed that the regret-ratio is often a made-up number and users may mistake its absolute value. Instead, users do understand the notion of rank. Thus it considered the problem of finding the minimal set $S$ with a rank-regret (the rank of top-1 tuple of $S$ in the sorted list of $D$) at most $k$, called the rank-regret representative (RRR) problem.    Corresponding to RMS, we focus on the min-error version of RRR, called the rank-regret minimization (RRM) problem, which finds a size $r$ set to minimize the maximum rank-regret for all utility functions. Further, we generalize RRM and propose the restricted RRM (i.e., RRRM) problem to optimize the rank-regret for functions restricted in a given space. Previous studies on both RMS and RRR did not consider the restricted function space. The solution for RRRM usually has a lower regret level and can better serve the specific preferences of some users. Note that RRM and RRRM are shift invariant. In 2D space, we design a dynamic programming algorithm 2DRRM to return the optimal solution for RRM. In HD space, we propose an algorithm **HDR**RM that introduces a double approximation guarantee on rank-regret. Both 2DRRM and **HDR**RM are applicable for RRRM. Extensive experiments on the synthetic and real datasets verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms. In particular, **HDR**RM always has the best output quality in experiments.
