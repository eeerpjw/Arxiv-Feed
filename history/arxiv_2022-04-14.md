> ABSTRACT  :  Despite the remarkable success on medical image analysis with deep learning, it is still under exploration regarding how to rapidly transfer AI models from one dataset to another for clinical applications. This paper presents a novel and generic human-in-the-loop scheme for efficiently transferring a segmentation model from a small-scale labelled dataset to a larger-scale unlabelled dataset for multi-organ segmentation in CT. To achieve this, we propose to use an igniter network which can learn from a small-scale labelled dataset and generate coarse annotations to start the process of human-machine interaction. Then, we use a sustainer network for our larger-scale dataset, and iteratively updated it on the new annotated data. Moreover, we propose a flexible labelling strategy for the annotator to reduce the initial annotation workload. The model performance and the time cost of annotation in each subject evaluated on our private dataset are reported and analysed. The results show that our scheme can not only improve the performance by 19.7% on Dice, but also expedite the cost time of manual labelling from 13.87 min to 1.51 min per CT volume during the model transfer, demonstrating the clinical usefulness with promising potentials.  
### Reuse your features: unifying retrieval and feature-metric alignment. (arXiv:2204.06292v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  We propose a compact pipeline to unify all the steps of Visual Localization: image retrieval, candidate re-ranking and initial pose estimation, and camera pose refinement. Our key assumption is that the deep features used for these individual tasks share common characteristics, so we should reuse them in all the procedures of the pipeline. Our DRAN (Deep Retrieval and image Alignment Network) is able to extract global descriptors for efficient image retrieval, use intermediate hierarchical features to re-rank the retrieval list and produce an intial pose guess, which is finally refined by means of a feature-metric optimization based on learned deep multi-scale dense features. DRAN is the first single network able to produce the features for the three steps of visual localization. DRAN achieves a competitive performance in terms of robustness and accuracy specially in extreme day-**night** changes.

> ABSTRACT  :  Although current salient object detection (SOD) works have achieved significant progress, they are limited when it comes to the integrity of the predicted salient regions. We define the concept of integrity at both a micro and macro level. Specifically, at the micro level, the model should highlight all parts that belong to a certain salient object. Meanwhile, at the macro level, the model needs to discover all salient objects in a given image. To facilitate integrity learning for SOD, we design a novel Integrity Cognition Network (ICON), which explores three important components for learning strong integrity features. 1) Unlike existing models, which focus more on feature discriminability, we introduce a diverse feature aggregation (DFA) component to aggregate features with various receptive fields (i.e., kernel shape and context) and increase feature diversity. Such diversity is the foundation for mining the integral salient objects. 2) Based on the DFA features, we introduce an integrity channel **enhancement** (ICE) component with the goal of enhancing feature channels that highlight the integral salient objects, while suppressing the other distracting ones. 3) After extracting the enhanced features, the part-whole verification (PWV) method is employed to determine whether the part and whole object features have strong agreement. Such part-whole agreements can further improve the micro-level integrity for each salient object. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our ICON, comprehensive experiments are conducted on seven challenging benchmarks. Our ICON outperforms the baseline methods in terms of a wide range of metrics. Notably, our ICON achieves about 10% relative improvement over the previous best model in terms of average false negative ratio (FNR), on six datasets. Codes and results are available at: https://github.com/mczhuge/ICON.  
### A Novel Transformer Based Semantic Segmentation Scheme for Fine-Resolution Remote Sensing Images. (arXiv:2104.12137v5 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  The fully convolutional network (FCN) with an encoder-decoder architecture has been the standard paradigm for semantic segmentation. The encoder-decoder architecture utilizes an encoder to capture multilevel feature maps, which are incorporated into the final prediction by a decoder. As the context is crucial for precise segmentation, tremendous effort has been made to extract such information in an intelligent fashion, including employing dilated/atrous convolutions or inserting attention modules. However, these endeavors are all based on the FCN architecture with ResNet or other backbones, which cannot fully exploit the context from the theoretical concept. By contrast, we introduce the **Swin** Transformer as the backbone to extract the context information and design a novel decoder of densely connected feature aggregation module (DCFAM) to restore the resolution and produce the segmentation map. The experimental results on two remotely sensed semantic segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

> ABSTRACT  :  Finetuning a pretrained backbone in the encoder part of an image transformer network has been the traditional approach for the semantic segmentation task. However, such an approach leaves out the semantic context that an image provides during the encoding stage. This paper argues that incorporating semantic information of the image into pretrained hierarchical transformer-based backbones while finetuning improves the performance considerably. To achieve this, we propose SeMask, a simple and effective framework that incorporates semantic information into the encoder with the help of a semantic attention operation. In addition, we use a lightweight semantic decoder during training to provide supervision to the intermediate semantic prior maps at every stage. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating semantic priors enhances the performance of the established hierarchical encoders with a slight increase in the number of FLOPs. We provide empirical proof by integrating SeMask into **Swin** Transformer and Mix Transformer backbones as our encoder paired with different decoders. Our framework achieves a new state-of-the-art of 58.25% mIoU on the ADE20K dataset and improvements of over 3% in the mIoU metric on the Cityscapes dataset. The code and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/SeMask-Segmentation .

### Receptive Field Analysis of Temporal Convolutional Networks for Monaural Speech Dereverberation. (arXiv:2204.06439v1 [cs.SD])
- Authors : William Ravenscroft, Stefan Goetze, Thomas Hain

> ABSTRACT  :  Speech dereverberation is often an important requirement in robust speech processing tasks. Supervised deep learning (DL) models give state-of-the-art performance for single-channel speech dereverberation. Temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) are commonly used for sequence modelling in speech **enhancement** tasks. A feature of TCNs is that they have a receptive field (RF) dependant on the specific model configuration which determines the number of input frames that can be observed to produce an individual output frame. It has been shown that TCNs are capable of performing dereverberation of simulated speech data, however a thorough analysis, especially with focus on the RF is yet lacking in the literature. This paper analyses dereverberation performance depending on the model size and the RF of TCNs. Experiments using the WHAMR corpus which is extended to include room impulse responses (RIRs) with larger T60 values demonstrate that a larger RF can have significant improvement in performance when training smaller TCN models. It is also demonstrated that TCNs benefit from a wider RF when dereverberating RIRs with larger RT60 values.  
### Learnable Hypergraph Laplacian for Hypergraph Learning. (arXiv:2106.06666v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Hypergraph Convolutional Neural Networks (HGCNNs) have demonstrated their potential in modeling high-order relations preserved in graph-structured data. However, most existing convolution filters are localized and determined by the pre-defined initial hypergraph topology, neglecting to explore implicit and long-range relations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose the first learning-based method tailored for constructing adaptive hypergraph structure, termed HypERgrAph Laplacian aDaptor (HERALD), which serves as a generic plug-and-play module for improving the representational power of HGCNNs.Specifically, HERALD adaptively optimizes the adjacency relationship between vertices and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner and thus the task-aware hypergraph is learned. Furthermore, HERALD employs the self-attention mechanism to capture the non-local paired-nodes relation. Extensive experiments on various popular hypergraph datasets for node classification and graph classification tasks demonstrate that our approach obtains consistent and considerable performance **enhancement**, proving its effectiveness and generalization ability.

### Optimizing generalized Gini indices for fairness in rankings. (arXiv:2204.06521v1 [cs.IR])
- Authors : Virginie Do, Nicolas Usunier
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06521](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06521)
> ABSTRACT  :  There is growing interest in designing recommender systems that aim at being fair towards item producers or their least satisfied users. Inspired by the domain of inequality measurement in economics, this paper explores the use of generalized Gini welfare functions (GGFs) as a means to specify the normative criterion that recommender systems should optimize for. GGFs weight individuals depending on their ranks in the population, giving more weight to worse-off individuals to promote equality. Depending on these weights, GGFs minimize the Gini index of item **exposure** to promote equality between items, or focus on the performance on specific quantiles of least satisfied users. GGFs for ranking are challenging to optimize because they are non-differentiable. We resolve this challenge by leveraging tools from non-smooth optimization and projection operators used in differentiable sorting. We present experiments using real datasets with up to 15k users and items, which show that our approach obtains better trade-offs than the baselines on a variety of recommendation tasks and fairness criteria.  
### A World-Self Model Towards Understanding Intelligence. (arXiv:2203.13762v2 [cs.AI] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Artificial intelligence has achieved tremendous successes in various tasks, while it is still out of question that there are big gaps between artificial and human intelligence, and the nature of intelligence is still in **dark**ness. In this work we will first stress the importance of defining the scope of discussion and choosing the right physical and informational granularity of investigation. We will carefully compare human and artificial intelligence, and propose that the information abstraction mechanism of human intelligence is the key to connect perception and cognition, and the lack of a new model is preventing the understanding and next-level implementation of intelligence. We will present the broader idea of "concept", the principles and mathematical frameworks of the new model World-Self Model (WSM) of intelligence, and finally an unified general framework of intelligence based on WSM. Rather than focusing on solving a specific problem or discussing a certain kind of intelligence, our work is instead towards a better understanding of the nature of the general phenomenon of intelligence, independent of the task or system of investigation.
