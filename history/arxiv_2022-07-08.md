### MaiT: Leverage Attention Masks for More Efficient Image Transformers. (arXiv:2207.03006v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Ling Li, Ali Shafiee, Joseph Hassoun
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03006](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03006)
> ABSTRACT  :  Though image transformers have shown competitive results with convolutional neural networks in computer vision tasks, lacking inductive biases such as locality still poses problems in terms of model efficiency especially for embedded applications. In this work, we address this issue by introducing attention masks to incorporate spatial locality into self-attention heads. Local dependencies are captured efficiently with masked attention heads along with global dependencies captured by unmasked attention heads. With Masked attention image Transformer - MaiT, top-1 accuracy increases by up to 1.7% compared to CaiT with fewer parameters and FLOPs, and the throughput improves by up to 1.5X compared to **Swin**. Encoding locality with attention masks is model agnostic, and thus it applies to monolithic, hierarchical, or other novel transformer architectures.  
### Back to the Basics: Revisiting Out-of-Distribution Detection Baselines. (arXiv:2207.03061v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Johnson Kuan, Jonas Mueller
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03061](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03061)
> ABSTRACT  :  We study simple methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) image detection that are compatible with any already trained classifier, relying on only its predictions or learned representations. Evaluating the OOD detection performance of various methods when utilized with ResNet-50 and **Swin** Transformer models, we find methods that solely consider the model's predictions can be easily outperformed by also considering the learned representations. Based on our analysis, we advocate for a dead-simple approach that has been neglected in other studies: simply flag as OOD images whose average distance to their K nearest neighbors is large (in the representation space of an image classifier trained on the in-distribution data).  
### Shadow-Background-Noise 3D Spatial Decomposition Using Sparse Low-Rank Gaussian Properties for Video-SAR Moving Target Shadow **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2207.03064v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Tianwen Zhang, Xiaoling Zhang, Zhenyu Yang, Xu Zhan, Jinyu Bao
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03064](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03064)
> ABSTRACT  :  Moving target shadows among video synthetic aperture radar (Video-SAR) images are always interfered by low scattering backgrounds and cluttered noises, causing poor moving target shadow detection-tracking performance. To solve this problem, this letter proposes a shadow-background-noise 3D spatial de-composition method named SBN-3D-SD to boost shadow saliency for better Video-SAR moving target shadow detection-tracking performance.  
### DRL-ISP: Multi-Objective Camera ISP with Deep Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2207.03081v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Ukcheol Shin, Kyunghyun Lee, In So
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03081](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03081)
> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we propose a multi-objective camera ISP framework that utilizes Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and camera ISP toolbox that consist of network-based and conventional ISP tools. The proposed DRL-based camera ISP framework iteratively selects a proper tool from the toolbox and applies it to the image to maximize a given vision task-specific reward function. For this purpose, we implement total 51 ISP tools that include **exposure** correction, color-and-tone correction, white balance, sharpening, denoising, and the others. We also propose an efficient DRL network architecture that can extract the various aspects of an image and make a rigid mapping relationship between images and a large number of actions. Our proposed DRL-based ISP framework effectively improves the image quality according to each vision task such as RAW-to-RGB image **restoration**, 2D object detection, and monocular depth estimation.  
### Masked Surfel Prediction for Self-Supervised Point Cloud Learning. (arXiv:2207.03111v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Yabin Zhang, Jiehong Lin, Chenhang He, Yongwei Chen, Kui Jia, **Lei Zhang**
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03111](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03111)
> ABSTRACT  :  Masked auto-encoding is a popular and effective self-supervised learning approach to point cloud learning. However, most of the existing methods reconstruct only the masked points and overlook the local geometry information, which is also important to understand the point cloud data. In this work, we make the first attempt, to the best of our knowledge, to consider the local geometry information explicitly into the masked auto-encoding, and propose a novel Masked Surfel Prediction (MaskSurf) method. Specifically, given the input point cloud masked at a high ratio, we learn a transformer-based encoder-decoder network to estimate the underlying masked surfels by simultaneously predicting the surfel positions (i.e., points) and per-surfel orientations (i.e., normals). The predictions of points and normals are supervised by the Chamfer Distance and a newly introduced Position-Indexed Normal Distance in a set-to-set manner. Our MaskSurf is validated on six downstream tasks under three fine-tuning strategies. In particular, MaskSurf outperforms its closest competitor, Point-MAE, by 1.2\% on the real-world dataset of ScanObjectNN under the OBJ-BG setting, justifying the advantages of masked surfel prediction over masked point cloud reconstruction. Codes will be available at https://github.com/YBZh/MaskSurf.  
### D2HNet: Joint Denoising and Deblurring with Hierarchical Network for Robust **Night** Image **Restoration**. (arXiv:2207.03294v1 [cs.CV])

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03294](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03294)
> ABSTRACT  :  **Night** imaging with modern smartphone cameras is troublesome due to low photon count and unavoidable noise in the imaging system. Directly adjusting **exposure** time and ISO ratings cannot obtain sharp and noise-free images at the same time in **low-light** conditions. Though many methods have been proposed to enhance noisy or blurry **night** images, their performances on real-world **night** photos are still unsatisfactory due to two main reasons: 1) Limited information in a single image and 2) Domain gap between synthetic training images and real-world photos (e.g., differences in blur area and resolution). To exploit the information from successive long- and short-**exposure** images, we propose a learning-based pipeline to fuse them. A D2HNet framework is developed to recover a high-quality image by deblurring and enhancing a long-**exposure** image under the guidance of a short-**exposure** image. To shrink the domain gap, we leverage a two-phase DeblurNet-EnhanceNet architecture, which performs accurate blur removal on a fixed low resolution so that it is able to handle large ranges of blur in different resolution inputs. In addition, we synthesize a D2-Dataset from HD videos and experiment on it. The results on the validation set and real photos demonstrate our methods achieve better visual quality and state-of-the-art quantitative scores. The D2HNet codes, models, and D2-Dataset can be found at https://github.com/zhaoyuzhi/D2HNet.  
### A Novel Unified Conditional Score-based Generative Framework for Multi-modal Medical Image Completion. (arXiv:2207.03430v1 [eess.IV])

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03430](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03430)
> ABSTRACT  :  Multi-modal medical image completion has been extensively applied to alleviate the missing modality issue in a wealth of multi-modal diagnostic tasks. However, for most existing synthesis methods, their inferences of missing modalities can collapse into a deterministic mapping from the available ones, ignoring the uncertainties inherent in the cross-modal relationships. Here, we propose the Unified Multi-Modal Conditional Score-based Generative Model (UMM-CSGM) to take advantage of Score-based Generative Model (SGM) in modeling and stochastically sampling a target probability distribution, and further extend SGM to cross-modal conditional synthesis for various missing-modality configurations in a unified framework. Specifically, UMM-CSGM employs a novel multi-in multi-out Conditional Score Network (mm-CSN) to learn a comprehensive set of cross-modal conditional distributions via conditional diffusion and reverse generation in the complete modality space. In this way, the generation process can be accurately conditioned by all available information, and can fit all possible configurations of missing modalities in a single network. Experiments on BraTS19 dataset show that the UMM-CSGM can more reliably synthesize the heterogeneous **enhancement** and irregular area in tumor-induced lesions for any missing modalities.  
### Self-Supervised Depth and Ego-Motion Estimation for Monocular Thermal Video Using Multi-Spectral Consistency Loss. (arXiv:2103.00760v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Ukcheol Shin, Kyunghyun Lee, Seokju Lee, In So
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00760](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00760)
> ABSTRACT  :  A thermal camera can robustly capture thermal radiation images under harsh light conditions such as **night** scenes, tunnels, and disaster scenarios. However, despite this advantage, neither depth nor ego-motion estimation research for the thermal camera have not been actively explored so far. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning method for depth and ego-motion estimation from thermal images. The proposed method exploits multi-spectral consistency that consists of temperature and photometric consistency loss. The temperature consistency loss provides a fundamental self-supervisory signal by reconstructing clipped and colorized thermal images. Additionally, we design a differentiable forward warping module that can transform the coordinate system of the estimated depth map and relative pose from thermal camera to visible camera. Based on the proposed module, the photometric consistency loss can provide complementary self-supervision to networks. Networks trained with the proposed method robustly estimate the depth and pose from monocular thermal video under **low-light** and even zero-light conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to simultaneously estimate both depth and ego-motion from monocular thermal video in a self-supervised manner.  
### Patient-specific modelling, simulation and **real time** processing for constrictive respiratory diseases. (arXiv:2207.01082v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Stavros Nousias

> ABSTRACT  :  Asthma is a common chronic disease of the respiratory system causing significant disability and societal burden. It affects over 500 million people worldwide and generates costs exceeding $USD 56 billion in 2011 in the United States. Managing asthma involves controlling symptoms, preventing exacerbations, and maintaining lung function. Improving asthma control affects the daily life of patients and is associated with a reduced risk of exacerbations and lung function impairment, reduces the cost of asthma care and indirect costs associated with reduced productivity. Understanding the complex dynamics of the pulmonary system and the lung's response to disease, injury, and treatment is fundamental to the advancement of Asthma treatment. Computational models of the respiratory system seek to provide a theoretical framework to understand the interaction between structure and function. Their application can improve pulmonary medicine by a patient-specific approach to medicinal methodologies optimizing the delivery given the personalized geometry and personalized ventilation patterns while introducing a patient-specific technique that maximizes drug delivery. A three-fold objective addressed within this dissertation becomes prominent at this point. The first part refers to the comprehension of pulmonary pathophysiology and the mechanics of Asthma and subsequently of constrictive pulmonary conditions in general. The second part refers to the design and implementation of tools that facilitate personalized medicine to improve delivery and effectiveness. Finally, the third part refers to the self-management of the condition, meaning that medical personnel and patients have access to tools and methods that allow the first party to easily track the course of the condition and the second party, i.e. the patient to easily self-manage it alleviating the significant burden from the health system.

### Semi-unsupervised Learning for Time Series Classification. (arXiv:2207.03119v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Padraig Davidson, Michael Steininger, Anna Krause, Andreas Hotho
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03119](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03119)
> ABSTRACT  :  Time series are ubiquitous and therefore inherently hard to analyze and ultimately to label or cluster. With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its smart devices, data is collected in large amounts any given second. The collected data is rich in information, as one can detect accidents (e.g. cars) in **real time**, or assess injury/sickness over a given time span (e.g. health devices). Due to its chaotic nature and massive amounts of datapoints, timeseries are hard to label manually. Furthermore new classes within the data could emerge over time (contrary to e.g. handwritten digits), which would require relabeling the data.    In this paper we present SuSL4TS, a deep generative Gaussian mixture model for semi-unsupervised learning, to classify time series data. With our approach we can alleviate manual labeling steps, since we can detect sparsely labeled classes (semi-supervised) and identify emerging classes hidden in the data (unsupervised). We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with established time series classification datasets from different domains.  
### Speech **Enhancement** with Score-Based Generative Models in the Complex STFT Domain. (arXiv:2203.17004v2 [eess.AS] UPDATED)
- Authors : Simon Welker, Julius Richter, Timo Gerkmann

> ABSTRACT  :  Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently shown impressive results for difficult generative tasks such as the unconditional and conditional generation of natural images and audio signals. In this work, we extend these models to the complex short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain, proposing a novel training task for speech **enhancement** using a complex-valued deep neural network. We derive this training task within the formalism of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), thereby enabling the use of predictor-corrector samplers. We provide alternative formulations inspired by previous publications on using generative diffusion models for speech **enhancement**, avoiding the need for any prior assumptions on the noise distribution and making the training task purely generative which, as we show, results in improved **enhancement** performance.

### Look\&Listen: Multi-Modal Correlation Learning for Active Speaker Detection and Speech **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2203.02216v2 [cs.SD] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Active speaker detection and speech **enhancement** have become two increasingly attractive topics in audio-visual scenario understanding. According to their respective characteristics, the scheme of independently designed architecture has been widely used in correspondence to each single task. This may lead to the representation learned by the model being task-specific, and inevitably result in the lack of generalization ability of the feature based on multi-modal modeling. More recent studies have shown that establishing cross-modal relationship between auditory and visual stream is a promising solution for the challenge of audio-visual multi-task learning. Therefore, as a motivation to bridge the multi-modal associations in audio-visual tasks, a unified framework is proposed to achieve target speaker detection and speech **enhancement** with joint learning of audio-visual modeling in this study.
