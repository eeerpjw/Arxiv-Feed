> ABSTRACT  :  While significant progress has been made in deep video denoising, it remains very challenging for exploiting historical and future frames. Bidirectional recurrent networks (BiRNN) have exhibited appealing performance in several video **restoration** tasks. However, BiRNN is intrinsically offline because it uses backward recurrent modules to propagate from the last to current frames, which causes high latency and large memory consumption. To address the offline issue of BiRNN, we present a novel recurrent network consisting of forward and look-ahead recurrent modules for unidirectional video denoising. Particularly, look-ahead module is an elaborate forward module for leveraging information from near-future frames. When denoising the current frame, the hidden features by forward and look-ahead recurrent modules are combined, thereby making it feasible to exploit both historical and near-future frames. Due to the scene motion between non-neighboring frames, border pixels missing may occur when warping look-ahead feature from near-future frame to current frame, which can be largely alleviated by incorporating forward warping and border enlargement. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with constant latency and memory consumption. The source code and pre-trained models will be publicly available.  
### **Night**Lab: A Dual-level Architecture with Hardness Detection for Segmentation at **Night**. (arXiv:2204.05538v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  The semantic segmentation of **night**time scenes is a challenging problem that is key to impactful applications like self-driving cars. Yet, it has received little attention compared to its daytime counterpart. In this paper, we propose **Night**Lab, a novel **night**time segmentation framework that leverages multiple deep learning models imbued with **night**-aware features to yield State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on multiple **night** segmentation benchmarks. Notably, **Night**Lab contains models at two levels of granularity, i.e. image and regional, and each level is composed of light adaptation and segmentation modules. Given a **night**time image, the image level model provides an initial segmentation estimate while, in parallel, a hardness detection module identifies regions and their surrounding context that need further analysis. A regional level model focuses on these difficult regions to provide a significantly improved segmentation. All the models in **Night**Lab are trained end-to-end using a set of proposed **night**-aware losses without handcrafted heuristics. Extensive experiments on the **Night**City and BDD100K datasets show **Night**Lab achieves SoTA performance compared to concurrent methods.  
### Towards Reliable Image Outpainting: Learning Structure-Aware Multimodal Fusion with Depth Guidance. (arXiv:2204.05543v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Image outpainting technology generates visually reasonable content regardless of authenticity, making it unreliable to serve for practical applications even though introducing additional modalities eg. the sketch. Since sparse depth maps are widely captured in robotics and autonomous systems, together with RGB images, we combine the sparse depth in the image outpainting task to provide more reliable performance. Concretely, we propose a Depth-Guided Outpainting Network (DGONet) to model the feature representations of different modalities differentially and learn the structure-aware cross-modal fusion. To this end, two components are designed to implement: 1) The Multimodal Learning Module produces unique depth and RGB feature representations from the perspectives of different modal characteristics. 2) The Depth Guidance Fusion Module leverages the complete depth modality to guide the establishment of RGB contents by progressive multimodal feature fusion. Furthermore, we specially design an additional constraint strategy consisting of Cross-modal Loss and Edge Loss to enhance ambiguous contours and expedite reliable content generation. Extensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate our superiority over the state-of-the-art methods with more reliable content generation.  
### **Swin**Net: **Swin** Transformer drives edge-aware RGB-D and RGB-T salient object detection. (arXiv:2204.05585v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Zhengyi Liu, Yacheng Tan, Qian He, Yun Xiao
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05585](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05585)
> ABSTRACT  :  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are good at extracting contexture features within certain receptive fields, while transformers can model the global long-range dependency features. By absorbing the advantage of transformer and the merit of CNN, **Swin** Transformer shows strong feature representation ability. Based on it, we propose a cross-modality fusion model **Swin**Net for RGB-D and RGB-T salient object detection. It is driven by **Swin** Transformer to extract the hierarchical features, boosted by attention mechanism to bridge the gap between two modalities, and guided by edge information to sharp the contour of salient object. To be specific, two-stream **Swin** Transformer encoder first extracts multi-modality features, and then spatial alignment and channel re-calibration module is presented to optimize intra-level cross-modality features. To clarify the fuzzy boundary, edge-guided decoder achieves inter-level cross-modality fusion under the guidance of edge features. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models on RGB-D and RGB-T datasets, showing that it provides more insight into the cross-modality complementarity task.  
### Super-Resolution for Selfie Biometrics: Introduction and Application to Face and Iris. (arXiv:2204.05688v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Fernando Alonso, Julian Fierrez, Josef Bigun

> ABSTRACT  :  The lack of resolution has a negative impact on the performance of image-based biometrics. Many applications which are becoming ubiquitous in mobile devices do not operate in a controlled environment, and their performance significantly drops due to the lack of pixel resolution. While many generic super-resolution techniques have been studied to restore low-resolution images for biometrics, the results obtained are not always as desired. Those generic methods are usually aimed to enhance the visual appearance of the scene. However, producing an overall visual **enhancement** of biometric images does not necessarily correlate with a better recognition performance. Such techniques are designed to restore generic images and therefore do not exploit the specific structure found in biometric images (e.g. iris or faces), which causes the solution to be sub-optimal. For this reason, super-resolution techniques have to be adapted for the particularities of images from a specific biometric modality. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the application of super-resolution to different biometric modalities, such as face iris, gait or fingerprint. This chapter presents an overview of recent advances in super-resolution reconstruction of face and iris images, which are the two prevalent modalities in selfie biometrics. We also provide experimental results using several state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms, demonstrating the benefits of using super-resolution to improve the quality of face and iris images prior to classification. In the reported experiments, we study the application of super-resolution to face and iris images captured in the visible range, using experimental setups that represent well the selfie biometrics scenario.  
### GARF: Gaussian Activated Radiance Fields for High Fidelity Reconstruction and Pose Estimation. (arXiv:2204.05735v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Despite Neural Radiance Fields (**NeRF**) showing compelling results in photorealistic novel views synthesis of real-world scenes, most existing approaches require accurate prior camera poses. Although approaches for jointly recovering the radiance field and camera pose exist (BARF), they rely on a cumbersome coarse-to-fine auxiliary positional embedding to ensure good performance. We present Gaussian Activated neural Radiance Fields (GARF), a new positional embedding-free neural radiance field architecture - employing Gaussian activations - that outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of high fidelity reconstruction and pose estimation.

> ABSTRACT  :  Due to their resilience to motion blur and high robustness in **low-light** and **high dynamic range** conditions, event cameras are poised to become enabling sensors for vision-based exploration on future Mars helicopter missions. However, existing event-based visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithms either suffer from high tracking errors or are brittle, since they cannot cope with significant depth uncertainties caused by an unforeseen loss of tracking or other effects. In this work, we introduce EKLT-VIO, which addresses both limitations by combining a state-of-the-art event-based frontend with a filter-based backend. This makes it both accurate and robust to uncertainties, outperforming event- and frame-based VIO algorithms on challenging benchmarks by 32%. In addition, we demonstrate accurate performance in hover-like conditions (outperforming existing event-based methods) as well as high robustness in newly collected Mars-like and high-dynamic-range sequences, where existing frame-based methods fail. In doing so, we show that event-based VIO is the way forward for vision-based exploration on Mars.  
### From Less to More: Spectral Splitting and Aggregation Network for Hyperspectral Face Super-Resolution. (arXiv:2108.13584v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  High-resolution (HR) hyperspectral face image plays an important role in face related computer vision tasks under uncontrolled conditions, such as **low-light** environment and spoofing attacks. However, the dense spectral bands of hyperspectral face images come at the cost of limited amount of photons reached a narrow spectral window on average, which greatly reduces the spatial resolution of hyperspectral face images. In this paper, we investigate how to adapt the deep learning techniques to hyperspectral face image super-resolution (HFSR), especially when the training samples are very limited. Benefiting from the amount of spectral bands, in which each band can be seen as an image, we present a spectral splitting and aggregation network (SSANet) for HFSR with limited training samples. In the shallow layers, we split the hyperspectral image into different spectral groups. Then, we gradually aggregate the neighbor bands at deeper layers to exploit spectral correlations. By this spectral splitting and aggregation strategy (SSAS), we can divide the original hyperspectral image into multiple samples (\emph{from less to more}) to support the efficient training of the network and effectively exploit the spectral correlations among spectrum. To cope with the challenge of small training sample size (S3) problem, we propose to expand the training samples by a self-representation model and symmetry-induced augmentation. Experiments show that SSANet can well model the joint correlations of spatial and spectral information. By expanding the training samples, SSANet can effectively alleviate the S3 problem.  
### Global-Local Context Network for Person Search. (arXiv:2112.02500v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Person search aims to jointly localize and identify a query person from natural, uncropped images, which has been actively studied over the past few years. In this paper, we delve into the rich context information globally and locally surrounding the target person, which we refer to as scene and group context, respectively. Unlike previous works that treat the two types of context individually, we exploit them in a unified global-local context network (GLCNet) with the intuitive aim of feature **enhancement**. Specifically, re-ID embeddings and context features are simultaneously learned in a multi-stage fashion, ultimately leading to enhanced, discriminative features for person search. We conduct the experiments on two person search benchmarks (i.e., CUHK-SYSU and PRW) as well as extend our approach to a more challenging setting (i.e., character search on MovieNet). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the consistent improvement of the proposed GLCNet over the state-of-the-art methods on all three datasets. Our source codes, pre-trained models, and the new setting w.r.t. character search are publicly available at: https://github.com/ZhengPeng7/GLCNet.  
### MixFormer: Mixing Features across Windows and Dimensions. (arXiv:2204.02557v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02557](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02557)
> ABSTRACT  :  While local-window self-attention performs notably in vision tasks, it suffers from limited receptive field and weak modeling capability issues. This is mainly because it performs self-attention within non-overlapped windows and shares weights on the channel dimension. We propose MixFormer to find a solution. First, we combine local-window self-attention with depth-wise convolution in a parallel design, modeling cross-window connections to enlarge the receptive fields. Second, we propose bi-directional interactions across branches to provide complementary clues in the channel and spatial dimensions. These two designs are integrated to achieve efficient feature mixing among windows and dimensions. Our MixFormer provides competitive results on image classification with EfficientNet and shows better results than RegNet and **Swin** Transformer. Performance in downstream tasks outperforms its alternatives by significant margins with less computational costs in 5 dense prediction tasks on MS COCO, ADE20k, and LVIS.

### HunYuan_tvr for Text-Video Retrivial. (arXiv:2204.03382v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Text-Video Retrieval plays an important role in multi-modal understanding and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Most existing methods focus on constructing contrastive pairs between whole videos and complete caption sentences, while ignoring fine-grained cross-modal relationships, e.g., short clips and phrases or single frame and word. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named HunYuan\_tvr, to explore hierarchical cross-modal interactions by simultaneously exploring video-sentence, clip-phrase, and frame-word relationships. Considering intrinsic semantic relations between frames, HunYuan\_tvr first performs self-attention to explore frame-wise correlations and adaptively clusters correlated frames into clip-level representations. Then, the clip-wise correlation is explored to aggregate clip representations into a compact one to describe the video globally. In this way, we can construct hierarchical video representations for frame-clip-video granularities, and also explore word-wise correlations to form word-phrase-sentence embeddings for the text modality. Finally, hierarchical contrastive learning is designed to explore cross-modal relationships,~\emph{i.e.,} frame-word, clip-phrase, and video-sentence, which enables HunYuan\_tvr to achieve a comprehensive multi-modal understanding. Further boosted by adaptive label denosing and marginal sample **enhancement**, HunYuan\_tvr obtains new state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, e.g., Rank@1 of 55.0%, 57.8%, 29.7%, 52.1%, and 57.3% on MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, DiDemo, and ActivityNet respectively.  
### NAN: Noise-Aware **NeRF**s for Burst-Denoising. (arXiv:2204.04668v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Burst denoising is now more relevant than ever, as computational photography helps overcome sensitivity issues inherent in mobile phones and small cameras. A major challenge in burst-denoising is in coping with pixel misalignment, which was so far handled with rather simplistic assumptions of simple motion, or the ability to align in pre-processing. Such assumptions are not realistic in the presence of large motion and high levels of noise. We show that Neural Radiance Fields (**NeRF**s), originally suggested for physics-based novel-view rendering, can serve as a powerful framework for burst denoising. **NeRF**s have an inherent capability of handling noise as they integrate information from multiple images, but they are limited in doing so, mainly since they build on pixel-wise operations which are suitable to ideal imaging conditions. Our approach, termed NAN, leverages inter-view and spatial information in **NeRF**s to better deal with noise. It achieves state-of-the-art results in burst denoising and is especially successful in coping with large movement and occlusions, under very high levels of noise. With the rapid advances in accelerating **NeRF**s, it could provide a powerful platform for denoising in challenging environments.

> ABSTRACT  :  Cryptocurrencies are no longer just the preferred option for cybercriminal activities on **dark**nets, due to the increasing adoption in mainstream applications. This is partly due to the transparency associated with the underpinning ledgers, where any individual can access the record of a transaction record on the public ledger. In this paper, we build a dataset comprising Bitcoin transactions between 12 July 2019 and 26 May 2021. This dataset (hereafter referred to as BABD-13) contains 13 types of Bitcoin addresses, 5 categories of indicators with 148 features, and 544,462 labeled data. We then use our proposed dataset on common machine learning models, namely: k-nearest neighbors algorithm, decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and XGBoost. The results show that the accuracy rates of these machine learning models on our proposed dataset are between 93.24% and 96.71%. We also analyze the proposed features and their relationships from the experiments, and propose a k-hop subgraph generation algorithm to extract a k-hop subgraph from the entire Bitcoin transaction graph constructed by the directed heterogeneous multigraph starting from a specific Bitcoin address node (e.g., a known transaction associated with a criminal investigation).

### **Enhancement** of Pitch Controllability using Timbre-Preserving Pitch Augmentation in FastPitch. (arXiv:2204.05753v1 [eess.AS])
- Authors : Hanbin Bae, Sun Joo
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05753](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05753)
> ABSTRACT  :  The recently developed pitch-controllable text-to-speech (TTS) model, i.e. FastPitch, was conditioned for the pitch contours. However, the quality of the synthesized speech degraded considerably for pitch values that deviated significantly from the average pitch; i.e. the ability to control pitch was limited. To address this issue, we propose two algorithms to improve the robustness of FastPitch. First, we propose a novel timbre-preserving pitch-shifting algorithm for natural pitch augmentation. Pitch-shifted speech samples sound more natural when using the proposed algorithm because the speaker's vocal timbre is maintained. Moreover, we propose a training algorithm that defines FastPitch using pitch-augmented speech datasets with different pitch ranges for the same sentence. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms improve the pitch controllability of FastPitch.
