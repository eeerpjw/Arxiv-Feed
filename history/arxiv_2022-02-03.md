> ABSTRACT  :  The problem of automated car damage assessment presents a major challenge in the auto repair and damage assessment industry. The domain has several application areas ranging from car assessment companies such as car rentals and body shops to accidental damage assessment for car insurance companies. In vehicle assessment, the damage can take any form including scratches, minor and major dents to missing parts. More often, the assessment area has a significant level of noise such as dirt, grease, oil or rush that makes an accurate identification challenging. Moreover, the identification of a particular part is the first step in the repair industry to have an accurate labour and part assessment where the presence of different car models, shapes and sizes makes the task even more challenging for a machine-learning model to perform well. To address these challenges, this research explores and applies various instance segmentation methodologies to evaluate the best performing models.    The scope of this work focusses on two genres of real-time instance segmentation models due to their industrial significance, namely SipMask and Yolact. These methodologies are evaluated against a previously reported car parts dataset (DSMLR) and an internally curated dataset extracted from local car repair workshops. The Yolact-based part localization and segmentation method performed well when compared to other real-time instance mechanisms with a mAP of 66.5. For the workshop repair dataset, SipMask++ reported better accuracies for object detection with a mAP of 57.0 with outcomes for AP_IoU=.50and AP_IoU=.75 reporting 72.0 and 67.0 respectively while Yolact was found to be a better performer for AP_s with 44.0 and 2.6 for object detection and segmentation categories respectively.

> ABSTRACT  :  Soccer has a considerable market share of the global sports industry, and the interest in viewing videos from soccer games continues to grow. In this respect, it is important to provide game summaries and highlights of the main game events. However, annotating and producing events and summaries often require expensive equipment and a lot of tedious, cumbersome, manual labor. Therefore, automating the video production pipeline providing fast game highlights at a much lower cost is seen as the "holy grail". In this context, recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have shown great potential. Still, state-of-the-art approaches are far from being adequate for practical scenarios that have demanding real-time requirements, as well as strict performance criteria (where at least the detection of official events such as goals and cards must be 100% accurate). In addition, event detection should be thoroughly enhanced by annotation and classification, proper clipping, generating short descriptions, selecting appropriate thumbnails for highlight clips, and finally, combining the event highlights into an overall game summary, similar to what is commonly aired during sports news. Even though the event tagging operation has by far received the most attention, an end-to-end video production pipeline also includes various other operations which serve the overall purpose of automated soccer analysis. This challenge aims to assist the automation of such a production pipeline using AI. In particular, we focus on the **enhancement** operations that take place after an event has been detected, namely event clipping (Task 1), thumbnail selection (Task 2), and game summarization (Task 3).

### An Eye for an Eye: Defending against Gradient-based Attacks with Gradients. (arXiv:2202.01117v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Deep learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In particular, gradient-based attacks have demonstrated high success rates recently. The gradient measures how each image pixel affects the model output, which contains critical information for generating malicious perturbations. In this paper, we show that the gradients can also be exploited as a powerful weapon to defend against adversarial attacks. By using both gradient maps and adversarial images as inputs, we propose a Two-stream **Restoration** Network (TRN) to restore the adversarial images. To optimally restore the perturbed images with two streams of inputs, a Gradient Map Estimation Mechanism is proposed to estimate the gradients of adversarial images, and a Fusion Block is designed in TRN to explore and fuse the information in two streams. Once trained, our TRN can defend against a wide range of attack methods without significantly degrading the performance of benign inputs. Also, our method is generalizable, scalable, and hard to bypass. Experimental results on CIFAR10, SVHN, and Fashion MNIST demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods.  
### The impact of removing head movements on audio-visual speech **enhancement**. (arXiv:2202.00538v2 [cs.SD] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  This paper investigates the impact of head movements on audio-visual speech **enhancement** (AVSE). Although being a common conversational feature, head movements have been ignored by past and recent studies: they challenge today's learning-based methods as they often degrade the performance of models that are trained on clean, frontal, and steady face images. To alleviate this problem, we propose to use robust face frontalization (RFF) in combination with an AVSE method based on a variational auto-encoder (VAE) model. We briefly describe the basic ingredients of the proposed pipeline and we perform experiments with a recently released audio-visual dataset. In the light of these experiments, and based on three standard metrics, namely STOI, PESQ and SI-SDR, we conclude that RFF improves the performance of AVSE by a considerable margin.

### FROB: Few-shot ROBust Model for Classification and Out-of-Distribution Detection. (arXiv:2111.15487v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Nowadays, classification and Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection in the few-shot setting remain challenging aims due to rarity and the limited samples in the few-shot setting, and because of adversarial attacks. Accomplishing these aims is important for critical systems in safety, security, and defence. In parallel, OoD detection is challenging since deep neural network classifiers set high confidence to OoD samples away from the training data. To address such limitations, we propose the Few-shot ROBust (FROB) model for classification and few-shot OoD detection. We devise FROB for improved robustness and reliable confidence prediction for few-shot OoD detection. We generate the support boundary of the normal class distribution and combine it with few-shot Outlier **Exposure** (OE). We propose a self-supervised learning few-shot confidence boundary methodology based on generative and discriminative models. The contribution of FROB is the combination of the generated boundary in a self-supervised learning manner and the imposition of low confidence at this learned boundary. FROB implicitly generates strong adversarial samples on the boundary and forces samples from OoD, including our boundary, to be less confident by the classifier. FROB achieves generalization to unseen OoD with applicability to unknown, in the wild, test sets that do not correlate to the training datasets. To improve robustness, FROB redesigns OE to work even for zero-shots. By including our boundary, FROB reduces the threshold linked to the model's few-shot robustness; it maintains the OoD performance approximately independent of the number of few-shots. The few-shot robustness analysis evaluation of FROB on different sets and on One-Class Classification (OCC) data shows that FROB achieves competitive performance and outperforms benchmarks in terms of robustness to the outlier few-shot sample population and variability.

### Large-scale Autonomous Flight with **Real-time** Semantic SLAM under Dense Forest Canopy. (arXiv:2109.06479v3 [cs.RO] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Semantic maps represent the environment using a set of semantically meaningful objects. This representation is storage-efficient, less ambiguous, and more informative, thus facilitating large-scale autonomy and the acquisition of actionable information in highly unstructured, GPS-denied environments. In this letter, we propose an integrated system that can perform large-scale autonomous flights and real-time semantic mapping in challenging under-canopy environments. We detect and model tree trunks and ground planes from LiDAR data, which are associated across scans and used to constrain robot poses as well as tree trunk models. The autonomous navigation module utilizes a multi-level planning and mapping framework and computes dynamically feasible trajectories that lead the UAV to build a semantic map of the user-defined region of interest in a computationally and storage efficient manner. A drift-compensation mechanism is designed to minimize the odometry drift using semantic SLAM outputs in **real time**, while maintaining planner optimality and controller stability. This leads the UAV to execute its mission accurately and safely at scale.
