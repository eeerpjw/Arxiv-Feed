> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we deal with the problem of monocular depth estimation for fisheye cameras in a self-supervised manner. A known issue of self-supervised depth estimation is that it suffers in **low-light**/over-**exposure** conditions and in large homogeneous regions. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel ordinal distillation loss that distills the ordinal information from a large teacher model. Such a teacher model, since having been trained on a large amount of diverse data, can capture the depth ordering information well, but lacks in preserving accurate scene geometry. Combined with self-supervised losses, we show that our model can not only generate reasonable depth maps in challenging environments but also better recover the scene geometry. We further leverage the fisheye cameras of an AR-Glasses device to collect an indoor dataset to facilitate evaluation.

> ABSTRACT  :  In stereoscope-based Minimally Invasive Surgeries (MIS), dense stereo matching plays an indispensable role in 3D shape recovery, AR, VR, and navigation tasks. Although numerous Deep Neural Network (DNN) approaches are proposed, the conventional prior-free approaches are still popular in the industry because of the lack of open-source annotated data set and the limitation of the task-specific pre-trained DNNs. Among the prior-free stereo matching algorithms, there is no successful real-time algorithm in none GPU environment for MIS. This paper proposes the first CPU-level real-time prior-free stereo matching algorithm for general MIS tasks. We achieve an average 17 Hz on 640*480 images with a single-core CPU (i5-9400) for surgical images. Meanwhile, it achieves slightly better accuracy than the popular ELAS. The patch-based fast disparity searching algorithm is adopted for the rectified stereo images. A coarse-to-fine Bayesian probability and a spatial Gaussian mixed model were proposed to evaluate the patch probability at different scales. An optional probability density function estimation algorithm was adopted to quantify the prediction variance. Extensive experiments demonstrated the proposed method's capability to handle ambiguities introduced by the textureless surfaces and the photometric inconsistency from the non-Lambertian reflectance and **dark** illumination. The estimated probability managed to balance the confidences of the patches for stereo images at different scales. It has similar or higher accuracy and fewer outliers than the baseline ELAS in MIS, while it is 4-5 times faster. The code and the synthetic data sets are available at https://github.com/JingweiSong/BDIS-v2.  
### Multitask AET with Orthogonal Tangent Regularity for **Dark** Object Detection. (arXiv:2205.03346v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  **Dark** environment becomes a challenge for computer vision algorithms owing to insufficient photons and undesirable noise. To enhance object detection in a **dark** environment, we propose a novel multitask auto encoding transformation (MAET) model which is able to explore the intrinsic pattern behind illumination translation. In a self-supervision manner, the MAET learns the intrinsic visual structure by encoding and decoding the realistic illumination-degrading transformation considering the physical noise model and image signal processing (ISP).    Based on this representation, we achieve the object detection task by decoding the bounding box coordinates and classes. To avoid the over-entanglement of two tasks, our MAET disentangles the object and degrading features by imposing an orthogonal tangent regularity. This forms a parametric manifold along which multitask predictions can be geometrically formulated by maximizing the orthogonality between the tangents along the outputs of respective tasks. Our framework can be implemented based on the mainstream object detection architecture and directly trained end-to-end using normal target detection datasets, such as VOC and COCO. We have achieved the state-of-the-art performance using synthetic and real-world datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/cuiziteng/MAET.  
### Uncertainty Quantification for Hyperspectral Image Denoising Frameworks based on Low-rank Matrix Approximation. (arXiv:2004.10959v4 [eess.IV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Jingwei Song, Shaobo Xia, Jun Wang, Mitesh Patel, Dong Chen
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10959](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10959)
> ABSTRACT  :  Sliding-window based low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) is a technique widely used in hyperspectral images (HSIs) denoising or completion. However, the uncertainty quantification of the restored HSI has not been addressed to date. Accurate uncertainty quantification of the denoised HSI facilitates to applications such as multi-source or multi-scale data fusion, data assimilation, and product uncertainty quantification, since these applications require an accurate approach to describe the statistical distributions of the input data. Therefore, we propose a prior-free closed-form element-wise uncertainty quantification method for LRMA-based HSI **restoration**. Our closed-form algorithm overcomes the difficulty of the HSI patch mixing problem caused by the sliding-window strategy used in the conventional LRMA process. The proposed approach only requires the uncertainty of the observed HSI and provides the uncertainty result relatively rapidly and with similar computational complexity as the LRMA technique. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the estimation accuracy of the proposed closed-form uncertainty approach. The method is robust to at least 10% random impulse noise at the cost of 10-20% of additional processing time compared to the LRMA. The experiments indicate that the proposed closed-form uncertainty quantification method is more applicable to real-world applications than the baseline Monte Carlo test, which is computationally expensive. The code is available in the attachment and will be released after the acceptance of this paper.  
### Beyond the Visible: A Survey on Cross-spectral Face Recognition. (arXiv:2201.04435v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Cross-spectral face recognition (CFR) refers to recognizing individuals using face images stemming from different spectral bands, such as infrared vs. visible. While CFR is inherently more challenging than classical face recognition due to significant variation in facial appearance caused by the modality gap, it is useful in many scenarios including **night**-vision biometrics and detecting presentation attacks. Recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have resulted in significant improvement in the performance of CFR systems. Given these developments, the contributions of this survey are three-fold. First, we provide an overview of CFR, by formalizing the CFR problem and presenting related applications. Secondly, we discuss the appropriate spectral bands for face recognition and discuss recent CFR methods, placing emphasis on deep neural networks. In particular we describe techniques that have been proposed to extract and compare heterogeneous features emerging from different spectral bands. We also discuss the datasets that have been used for evaluating CFR methods. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future lines of research on this topic.

> ABSTRACT  :  Gait phase detection with convolution neural network provides accurate classification but demands high computational cost, which inhibits **real time** low power on-sensor processing.

### Out-of-Distribution Detection for Medical Applications: Guidelines for Practical Evaluation. (arXiv:2109.14885v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14885](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14885)
> ABSTRACT  :  Detection of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples in **real time** is a crucial safety check for deployment of machine learning models in the medical field. Despite a growing number of uncertainty quantification techniques, there is a lack of evaluation guidelines on how to select OOD detection methods in practice. This gap impedes implementation of OOD detection methods for real-world applications. Here, we propose a series of practical considerations and tests to choose the best OOD detector for a specific medical dataset. These guidelines are illustrated on a real-life use case of Electronic Health Records (EHR). Our results can serve as a guide for implementation of OOD detection methods in clinical practice, mitigating risks associated with the use of machine learning models in healthcare.  
### Building a 3-Player Mahjong AI using Deep Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2202.12847v2 [cs.AI] UPDATED)
- Authors : Xiangyu Zhao

> ABSTRACT  :  Mahjong is a popular multi-player imperfect-information game developed in China in the late 19th-century, with some very challenging features for AI research. Sanma, being a 3-player variant of the Japanese Riichi Mahjong, possesses unique characteristics including fewer tiles and, consequently, a more aggressive playing style. It is thus challenging and of great research interest in its own right, but has not yet been explored. In this paper, we present Meowjong, an AI for Sanma using deep reinforcement learning. We define an informative and compact 2-dimensional data structure for encoding the observable information in a Sanma game. We pre-train 5 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for Sanma's 5 actions -- discard, Pon, Kan, Kita and Riichi, and enhance the major action's model, namely the discard model, via self-play reinforcement learning using the Monte Carlo policy gradient method. Meowjong's models achieve test accuracies comparable with AIs for 4-player Mahjong through supervised learning, and gain a significant further **enhancement** from reinforcement learning. Being the first ever AI in Sanma, we claim that Meowjong stands as a state-of-the-art in this game.

### Information Fragmentation, Encryption and Information Flow in Complex Biological Networks. (arXiv:2105.13585v2 [cs.IT] UPDATED)
- Authors : Clifford Bohm, Douglas Kirkpatrick, Victoria Cao, Christoph Adami
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13585](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13585)
> ABSTRACT  :  Assessing where and how information is stored in biological networks (such as neuronal and genetic networks) is a central task both in neuroscience and in molecular genetics, but most available tools focus on the network's structure as opposed to its function. Here we introduce a new information-theoretic tool: "information fragmentation analysis" that, given full phenotypic data, allows us to localize information in complex networks, determine how fragmented (across multiple nodes of the network) the information is, and assess the level of encryption of that information. Using information fragmentation matrices, we can also create information flow graphs that illustrate how information propagates through these networks. We illustrate the use of this tool by analyzing how artificial brains that evolved "in silico" solve particular tasks, and show how information fragmentation analysis provides deeper insights into how these brains process information and "think". The measures of information fragmentation and encryption that result from our methods also quantify complexity of information processing in these networks and how this processing complexity differs between primary **exposure** to sensory data (early in the lifetime) and later routine processing.
