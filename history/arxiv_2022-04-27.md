### Assessing the ability of generative adversarial networks to learn canonical medical image statistics. (arXiv:2204.12007v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors : Prabhat KC, Rongping Zeng

> ABSTRACT  :  In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained tremendous popularity for potential applications in medical imaging, such as medical image synthesis, **restoration**, reconstruction, translation, as well as objective image quality assessment. Despite the impressive progress in generating high-resolution, perceptually realistic images, it is not clear if modern GANs reliably learn the statistics that are meaningful to a downstream medical imaging application. In this work, the ability of a state-of-the-art GAN to learn the statistics of canonical stochastic image models (SIMs) that are relevant to objective assessment of image quality is investigated. It is shown that although the employed GAN successfully learned several basic first- and second-order statistics of the specific medical SIMs under consideration and generated images with high perceptual quality, it failed to correctly learn several per-image statistics pertinent to the these SIMs, highlighting the urgent need to assess medical image GANs in terms of objective measures of image quality.

> ABSTRACT  :  Bit-depth expansion (BDE) is one of the emerging technologies to display high bit-depth (HBD) image from low bit-depth (LBD) source. Existing BDE methods have no unified solution for various BDE situations, and directly learn a mapping for each pixel from LBD image to the desired value in HBD image, which may change the given high-order bits and lead to a huge deviation from the ground truth. In this paper, we design a bit **restoration** network (BRNet) to learn a weight for each pixel, which indicates the ratio of the replenished value within a rational range, invoking an accurate solution without modifying the given high-order bit information. To make the network adaptive for any bit-depth degradation, we investigate the issue in an optimization perspective and train the network under progressive training strategy for better performance. Moreover, we employ Wasserstein distance as a visual quality indicator to evaluate the difference of color distribution between restored image and the ground truth. Experimental results show our method can restore colorful images with fewer artifacts and false contours, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with higher PSNR/SSIM results and lower Wasserstein distance.

> ABSTRACT  :  We propose a method for compressively acquiring a dynamic light field (a 5-D volume) through a single-shot coded image (a 2-D measurement). We designed an imaging model that synchronously applies aperture coding and pixel-wise **exposure** coding within a single **exposure** time. This coding scheme enables us to effectively embed the original information into a single observed image. The observed image is then fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN) for light-field reconstruction, which is jointly trained with the camera-side coding patterns. We also developed a hardware prototype to capture a real 3-D scene moving over time. We succeeded in acquiring a dynamic light field with 5x5 viewpoints over 4 temporal sub-frames (100 views in total) from a single observed image. Repeating capture and reconstruction processes over time, we can acquire a dynamic light field at 4x the frame rate of the camera. To our knowledge, our method is the first to achieve a finer temporal resolution than the camera itself in compressive light-field acquisition. Our software is available from our project webpage

> ABSTRACT  :  Image **restoration** tasks have witnessed great performance improvement in recent years by developing large deep models. Despite the outstanding performance, the heavy computation demanded by the deep models has restricted the application of image **restoration**. To lift the restriction, it is required to reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. Recently, N:M structured pruning has appeared as one of the effective and practical pruning approaches for making the model efficient with the accuracy constraint. However, it fails to account for different computational complexities and performance requirements for different layers of an image **restoration** network. To further optimize the trade-off between the efficiency and the **restoration** accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio for N:M structured sparsity at each layer. Extensive experimental results on super-resolution and deblurring tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method which outperforms previous pruning methods significantly. PyTorch implementation for the proposed methods will be publicly available at https://github.com/JungHunOh/SLS_CVPR2022.

> ABSTRACT  :  Infrared cameras are often utilized to enhance the **night** vision since the visible light cameras exhibit inferior efficacy without sufficient illumination. However, infrared data possesses inadequate color contrast and representation ability attributed to its intrinsic heat-related imaging principle. This makes it arduous to capture and analyze information for human beings, meanwhile hindering its application. Although, the domain gaps between unpaired **night**time infrared and daytime visible videos are even huger than paired ones that captured at the same time, establishing an effective translation mapping will greatly contribute to various fields. In this case, the structural knowledge within **night**time infrared videos and semantic information contained in the translated daytime visible pairs could be utilized simultaneously. To this end, we propose a tailored framework ROMA that couples with our introduced cRoss-domain regiOn siMilarity mAtching technique for bridging the huge gaps. To be specific, ROMA could efficiently translate the unpaired **night**time infrared videos into fine-grained daytime visible ones, meanwhile maintain the spatiotemporal consistency via matching the cross-domain region similarity. Furthermore, we design a multiscale region-wise discriminator to distinguish the details from synthesized visible results and real references. Extensive experiments and evaluations for specific applications indicate ROMA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we provide a new and challenging dataset encouraging further research for unpaired **night**time infrared and daytime visible video translation, named InfraredCity. In particular, it consists of 9 long video clips including City, Highway and Monitor scenarios. All clips could be split into 603,142 frames in total, which are 20 times larger than the recently released daytime infrared-to-visible dataset IRVI.  
### Towards Light-weight and **Real-time** Line Segment Detection. (arXiv:2106.00186v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Previous deep learning-based line segment detection (LSD) suffers from the immense model size and high computational cost for line prediction. This constrains them from real-time inference on computationally restricted environments. In this paper, we propose a real-time and light-weight line segment detector for resource-constrained environments named Mobile LSD (M-LSD). We design an extremely efficient LSD architecture by minimizing the backbone network and removing the typical multi-module process for line prediction found in previous methods. To maintain competitive performance with a light-weight network, we present novel training schemes: Segments of Line segment (SoL) augmentation, matching and geometric loss. SoL augmentation splits a line segment into multiple subparts, which are used to provide auxiliary line data during the training process. Moreover, the matching and geometric loss allow a model to capture additional geometric cues. Compared with TP-LSD-Lite, previously the best real-time LSD method, our model (M-LSD-tiny) achieves competitive performance with 2.5% of model size and an increase of 130.5% in inference speed on GPU. Furthermore, our model runs at 56.8 FPS and 48.6 FPS on the latest Android and iPhone mobile devices, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-time deep LSD available on mobile devices. Our code is available.

> ABSTRACT  :  We present a method for learning a generative 3D model based on neural radiance fields, trained solely from data with only single views of each object. While generating realistic images is no longer a difficult task, producing the corresponding 3D structure such that they can be rendered from different views is non-trivial. We show that, unlike existing methods, one does not need multi-view data to achieve this goal. Specifically, we show that by reconstructing many images aligned to an approximate canonical pose with a single network conditioned on a shared latent space, you can learn a space of radiance fields that models shape and appearance for a class of objects. We demonstrate this by training models to reconstruct object categories using datasets that contain only one view of each subject without depth or geometry information. Our experiments show that we achieve state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and high-quality results for monocular depth prediction.  
### NAFSSR: Stereo Image Super-Resolution Using NAFNet. (arXiv:2204.08714v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Stereo image super-resolution aims at enhancing the quality of super-resolution results by utilizing the complementary information provided by binocular systems. To obtain reasonable performance, most methods focus on finely designing modules, loss functions, and etc. to exploit information from another viewpoint. This has the side effect of increasing system complexity, making it difficult for researchers to evaluate new ideas and compare methods. This paper inherits a strong and simple image **restoration** model, NAFNet, for single-view feature extraction and extends it by adding cross attention modules to fuse features between views to adapt to binocular scenarios. The proposed baseline for stereo image super-resolution is noted as NAFSSR. Furthermore, training/testing strategies are proposed to fully exploit the performance of NAFSSR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In particular, NAFSSR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, Middlebury, and Flickr1024 datasets. With NAFSSR, we won 1st place in the NTIRE 2022 Stereo Image Super-resolution Challenge. Codes and models will be released at https://github.com/megvii-research/NAFNet.

### Automated detection of **dark** patterns in cookie banners: how to do it poorly and why it is hard to do it any other way. (arXiv:2204.11836v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Than Htut, Cristiana Teixeira, Marija Slavkovik
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11836](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11836)
> ABSTRACT  :  Cookie banners, the pop ups that appear to collect your consent for data collection, are a tempting ground for **dark** patterns. **Dark** patterns are design elements that are used to influence the user's choice towards an option that is not in their interest. The use of **dark** patterns renders consent elicitation meaningless and voids the attempts to improve a fair collection and use of data. Can machine learning be used to automatically detect the presence of **dark** patterns in cookie banners? In this work, a dataset of cookie banners of 300 news websites was used to train a prediction model that does exactly that. The machine learning pipeline we used includes feature engineering, parameter search, training a Gradient Boosted Tree classifier and evaluation. The accuracy of the trained model is promising, but allows a lot of room for improvement. We provide an in-depth analysis of the interdisciplinary challenges that automated **dark** pattern detection poses to artificial intelligence. The dataset and all the code created using machine learning is available at the url to repository removed for review.  
### Dynamic Ensemble Bayesian Filter for Robust Control of a Human Brain-machine Interface. (arXiv:2204.11840v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  Objective: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to provide direct brain control of devices such as prostheses and computer cursors, which have demonstrated great potential for mobility **restoration**. One major limitation of current BMIs lies in the unstable performance in online control due to the variability of neural signals, which seriously hinders the clinical availability of BMIs. Method: To deal with the neural variability in online BMI control, we propose a dynamic ensemble Bayesian filter (DyEnsemble). DyEnsemble extends Bayesian filters with a dynamic measurement model, which adjusts its parameters in time adaptively with neural changes. This is achieved by learning a pool of candidate functions and dynamically weighting and assembling them according to neural signals. In this way, DyEnsemble copes with variability in signals and improves the robustness of online control. Results: Online BMI experiments with a human participant demonstrate that, compared with the velocity Kalman filter, DyEnsemble significantly improves the control accuracy (increases the success rate by 13.9% and reduces the reach time by 13.5% in the random target pursuit task) and robustness (performs more stably over different experiment days). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the superiority of DyEnsemble in online BMI control. Significance: DyEnsemble frames a novel and flexible framework for robust neural decoding, which is beneficial to different neural decoding applications.

> ABSTRACT  :  Risk assessment is a substantial problem for financial institutions that has been extensively studied both for its methodological richness and its various practical applications. With the expansion of inclusive finance, recent attentions are paid to micro and small-sized enterprises (MSEs). Compared with large companies, MSEs present a higher **exposure** rate to default owing to their insecure financial stability. Conventional efforts learn classifiers from historical data with elaborate feature engineering. However, the main obstacle for MSEs involves severe deficiency in credit-related information, which may degrade the performance of prediction. Besides, financial activities have diverse explicit and implicit relations, which have not been fully exploited for risk judgement in commercial banks. In particular, the observations on real data show that various relationships between company users have additional power in financial risk analysis. In this paper, we consider a graph of banking data, and propose a novel HIDAM model for the purpose. Specifically, we attempt to incorporate heterogeneous information network with rich attributes on multi-typed nodes and links for modeling the scenario of business banking service. To enhance feature representation of MSEs, we extract interactive information through meta-paths and fully exploit path information. Furthermore, we devise a hierarchical attention mechanism respectively to learn the importance of contents inside each meta-path and the importance of different metapahs. Experimental results verify that HIDAM outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on real-world banking data.  
### Cross Pairwise Ranking for Unbiased Item Recommendation. (arXiv:2204.12176v1 [cs.IR])

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12176](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12176)
> ABSTRACT  :  Most recommender systems optimize the model on observed interaction data, which is affected by the previous **exposure** mechanism and exhibits many biases like popularity bias. The loss functions, such as the mostly used pointwise Binary Cross-Entropy and pairwise Bayesian Personalized Ranking, are not designed to consider the biases in observed data. As a result, the model optimized on the loss would inherit the data biases, or even worse, amplify the biases. For example, a few popular items take up more and more **exposure** opportunities, severely hurting the recommendation quality on niche items -- known as the notorious Mathew effect. In this work, we develop a new learning paradigm named Cross Pairwise Ranking (CPR) that achieves unbiased recommendation without knowing the **exposure** mechanism. Distinct from inverse propensity scoring (IPS), we change the loss term of a sample -- we innovatively sample multiple observed interactions once and form the loss as the combination of their predictions. We prove in theory that this way offsets the influence of user/item propensity on the learning, removing the influence of data biases caused by the **exposure** mechanism. Advantageous to IPS, our proposed CPR ensures unbiased learning for each training instance without the need of setting the propensity scores. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CPR over state-of-the-art debiasing solutions in both model generalization and training efficiency. The codes are available at https://github.com/Qcactus/CPR.

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12301](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12301)
> ABSTRACT  :  We design new visual illusions by finding "adversarial examples" for principled models of human perception -- specifically, for probabilistic models, which treat vision as Bayesian inference. To perform this search efficiently, we design a differentiable probabilistic programming language, whose API exposes MCMC inference as a first-class differentiable function. We demonstrate our method by automatically creating illusions for three features of human vision: **color constancy**, size constancy, and face perception.

> ABSTRACT  :  Accelerated ripening through the **exposure** of fruits to controlled environmental conditions and gases is nowadays one of the most assessed food technologies, especially for climacteric and exotic products. However, a fine granularity control of the process and consequently of the quality of the goods is still missing, so the management of the ripening rooms is mainly based on qualitative estimations only. Following the modern paradigms of Industry 4.0, this contribution proposes a non-destructive RFID-based system for the automatic evaluation of the live ripening of avocados. The system, coupled with a properly trained automatic classification algorithm based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), can discriminate the stage of ripening with an accuracy greater than 85%.

> ABSTRACT  :  Recent years have witnessed the dramatic growth of paper volumes with plenty of new research papers published every day, especially in the area of computer science. How to glean papers worth reading from the massive literature to do a quick survey or keep up with the latest advancement about a specific research topic has become a challenging task. Existing academic search engines such as Google Scholar return relevant papers by individually calculating the relevance between each paper and query. However, such systems usually omit the prerequisite chains of a research topic and cannot form a meaningful reading path. In this paper, we introduce a new task named Reading Path Generation (RPG) which aims at automatically producing a path of papers to read for a given query. To serve as a research benchmark, we further propose SurveyBank, a dataset consisting of large quantities of survey papers in the field of computer science as well as their citation relationships. Each survey paper contains key phrases extracted from its title and multi-level reading lists inferred from its references. Furthermore, we propose a graph-optimization-based approach for reading path generation which takes the relationship between papers into account. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms other baselines. A **Real-time** Reading Path Generation System (RePaGer) has been also implemented with our designed model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to target this important research problem. Our source code of RePaGer system and SurveyBank dataset can be found on here.  
### Automated machine learning for secure key rate in discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution. (arXiv:2201.09419v2 [quant-ph] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV QKD) with discrete modulation has attracted increasing attention due to its experimental simplicity, lower-cost implementation and compatibility with classical optical communication. Correspondingly, some novel numerical methods have been proposed to analyze the security of these protocols against collective attacks, which promotes key rates over one hundred kilometers of fiber distance. However, numerical methods are limited by their calculation time and resource consumption, for which they cannot play more roles on mobile platforms in quantum networks. To improve this issue, a neural network model predicting key rates in nearly **real time** has been proposed previously. Here, we go further and show a neural network model combined with Bayesian optimization. This model automatically designs the best architecture of neural network computing key rates in **real time**. We demonstrate our model with two variants of CV QKD protocols with quaternary modulation. The results show high reliability with secure probability as high as $99.15\%-99.59\%$, considerable tightness and high efficiency with speedup of approximately $10^7$ in both cases. This inspiring model enables the real-time computation of unstructured quantum key distribution protocols' key rate more automatically and efficiently, which has met the growing needs of implementing QKD protocols on moving platforms.

> ABSTRACT  :  Speech emotion recognition systems have high prediction latency because of the high computational requirements for deep learning models and low generalizability mainly because of the poor reliability of emotional measurements across multiple corpora. To solve these problems, we present a speech emotion recognition system based on a reductionist approach of decomposing and analyzing syllable-level features. Mel-spectrogram of an audio stream is decomposed into syllable-level components, which are then analyzed to extract statistical features. The proposed method uses formant attention, noise-gate filtering, and rolling normalization contexts to increase feature processing speed and tolerance to adversity. A set of syllable-level formant features is extracted and fed into a single hidden layer neural network that makes predictions for each syllable as opposed to the conventional approach of using a sophisticated deep learner to make sentence-wide predictions. The syllable level predictions help to achieve the real-time latency and lower the aggregated error in utterance level cross-corpus predictions. The experiments on IEMOCAP (IE), MSP-Improv (MI), and RAVDESS (RA) databases show that the method archives real-time latency while predicting with state-of-the-art cross-corpus unweighted accuracy of 47.6% for IE to MI and 56.2% for MI to IE.

> ABSTRACT  :  Objective: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to provide direct brain control of devices such as prostheses and computer cursors, which have demonstrated great potential for mobility **restoration**. One major limitation of current BMIs lies in the unstable performance in online control due to the variability of neural signals, which seriously hinders the clinical availability of BMIs. Method: To deal with the neural variability in online BMI control, we propose a dynamic ensemble Bayesian filter (DyEnsemble). DyEnsemble extends Bayesian filters with a dynamic measurement model, which adjusts its parameters in time adaptively with neural changes. This is achieved by learning a pool of candidate functions and dynamically weighting and assembling them according to neural signals. In this way, DyEnsemble copes with variability in signals and improves the robustness of online control. Results: Online BMI experiments with a human participant demonstrate that, compared with the velocity Kalman filter, DyEnsemble significantly improves the control accuracy (increases the success rate by 13.9% and reduces the reach time by 13.5% in the random target pursuit task) and robustness (performs more stably over different experiment days). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the superiority of DyEnsemble in online BMI control. Significance: DyEnsemble frames a novel and flexible framework for robust neural decoding, which is beneficial to different neural decoding applications.

> ABSTRACT  :  Risk assessment is a substantial problem for financial institutions that has been extensively studied both for its methodological richness and its various practical applications. With the expansion of inclusive finance, recent attentions are paid to micro and small-sized enterprises (MSEs). Compared with large companies, MSEs present a higher **exposure** rate to default owing to their insecure financial stability. Conventional efforts learn classifiers from historical data with elaborate feature engineering. However, the main obstacle for MSEs involves severe deficiency in credit-related information, which may degrade the performance of prediction. Besides, financial activities have diverse explicit and implicit relations, which have not been fully exploited for risk judgement in commercial banks. In particular, the observations on real data show that various relationships between company users have additional power in financial risk analysis. In this paper, we consider a graph of banking data, and propose a novel HIDAM model for the purpose. Specifically, we attempt to incorporate heterogeneous information network with rich attributes on multi-typed nodes and links for modeling the scenario of business banking service. To enhance feature representation of MSEs, we extract interactive information through meta-paths and fully exploit path information. Furthermore, we devise a hierarchical attention mechanism respectively to learn the importance of contents inside each meta-path and the importance of different metapahs. Experimental results verify that HIDAM outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on real-world banking data.

> ABSTRACT  :  We design new visual illusions by finding "adversarial examples" for principled models of human perception -- specifically, for probabilistic models, which treat vision as Bayesian inference. To perform this search efficiently, we design a differentiable probabilistic programming language, whose API exposes MCMC inference as a first-class differentiable function. We demonstrate our method by automatically creating illusions for three features of human vision: **color constancy**, size constancy, and face perception.
