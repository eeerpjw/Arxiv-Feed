> ABSTRACT  :  Most existing deep-learning-based single image dynamic scene blind deblurring (SIDSBD) methods usually design deep networks to directly remove the spatially-variant motion blurs from one inputted motion blurred image, without blur kernels estimation. In this paper, inspired by the Projective Motion Path Blur (PMPB) model and deformable convolution, we propose a novel constrained deformable convolutional network (CDCN) for efficient single image dynamic scene blind deblurring, which simultaneously achieves accurate spatially-variant motion blur kernels estimation and the high-quality image **restoration** from only one observed motion blurred image. In our proposed CDCN, we first construct a novel multi-scale multi-level multi-input multi-output (MSML-MIMO) encoder-decoder architecture for more powerful features extraction ability. Second, different from the DLVBD methods that use multiple consecutive frames, a novel constrained deformable convolution reblurring (CDCR) strategy is proposed, in which the deformable convolution is first applied to blurred features of the inputted single motion blurred image for learning the sampling points of motion blur kernel of each pixel, which is similar to the estimation of the motion density function of the camera shake in the PMPB model, and then a novel PMPB-based reblurring loss function is proposed to constrain the learned sampling points convergence, which can make the learned sampling points match with the relative motion trajectory of each pixel better and promote the accuracy of the spatially-variant motion blur kernels estimation.

> ABSTRACT  :  Deep neural network based object detectors are continuously evolving and are used in a multitude of applications, each having its own set of requirements. While safety-critical applications need high accuracy and reliability, low-latency tasks need resource and energy-efficient networks. **Real-time** detectors, which are a necessity in high-impact real-world applications, are continuously proposed, but they overemphasize the improvements in accuracy and speed while other capabilities such as versatility, robustness, resource and energy efficiency are omitted. A reference benchmark for existing networks does not exist, nor does a standard evaluation guideline for designing new networks, which results in ambiguous and inconsistent comparisons. We, thus, conduct a comprehensive study on multiple real-time detectors (anchor-, keypoint-, and transformer-based) on a wide range of datasets and report results on an extensive set of metrics. We also study the impact of variables such as image size, anchor dimensions, confidence thresholds, and architecture layers on the overall performance. We analyze the robustness of detection networks against distribution shifts, natural corruptions, and adversarial attacks. Also, we provide a calibration analysis to gauge the reliability of the predictions. Finally, to highlight the real-world impact, we conduct two unique case studies, on autonomous driving and healthcare applications. To further gauge the capability of networks in critical real-time applications, we report the performance after deploying the detection networks on edge devices. Our extensive empirical study can act as a guideline for the industrial community to make an informed choice on the existing networks. We also hope to inspire the research community towards a new direction in the design and evaluation of networks that focuses on a bigger and holistic overview for a far-reaching impact.

> ABSTRACT  :  Modern sky surveys are producing ever larger amounts of observational data, which makes the application of classical approaches for the classification and analysis of objects challenging and time-consuming. However, this issue may be significantly mitigated by the application of automatic machine and deep learning methods. We propose ULISSE, a new deep learning tool that, starting from a single prototype object, is capable of identifying objects sharing the same morphological and photometric properties, and hence of creating a list of candidate sosia. In this work, we focus on applying our method to the detection of AGN candidates in a Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy sample, since the identification and classification of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the optical band still remains a challenging task in extragalactic astronomy. Intended for the initial exploration of large sky surveys, ULISSE directly uses features extracted from the ImageNet dataset to perform a similarity search. The method is capable of rapidly identifying a list of candidates, starting from only a single image of a given prototype, without the need for any time-consuming neural network training. Our experiments show ULISSE is able to identify AGN candidates based on a combination of host galaxy morphology, color and the presence of a central nuclear source, with a retrieval efficiency ranging from 21% to 65% (including composite sources) depending on the prototype, where the random guess baseline is 12%. We find ULISSE to be most effective in retrieving AGN in early-type host galaxies, as opposed to prototypes with spiral- or late-type properties. Based on the results described in this work, ULISSE can be a promising tool for selecting different types of astrophysical objects in current and future wide-field surveys (e.g. Euclid, LSST etc.) that target millions of sources every single **night**.

> ABSTRACT  :  **Low-light** video **enhancement** (LLVE) is an important yet challenging task with many applications such as photographing and autonomous driving. Unlike single image **low-light** **enhancement**, most LLVE methods utilize temporal information from adjacent frames to restore the color and remove the noise of the target frame. However, these algorithms, based on the framework of multi-frame alignment and **enhancement**, may produce multi-frame fusion artifacts when encountering extreme **low light** or fast motion. In this paper, inspired by the low latency and **high dynamic range** of events, we use synthetic events from multiple frames to guide the **enhancement** and **restoration** of **low-light** videos. Our method contains three stages: 1) event synthesis and **enhancement**, 2) event and image fusion, and 3) **low-light** **enhancement**. In this framework, we design two novel modules (event-image fusion transform and event-guided dual branch) for the second and third stages, respectively. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing **low-light** video or single image **enhancement** approaches on both synthetic and real LLVE datasets.  
### MorphMLP: An Efficient MLP-Like Backbone for Spatial-Temporal Representation Learning. (arXiv:2111.12527v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Recently, MLP-Like networks have been revived for image recognition. However, whether it is possible to build a generic MLP-Like architecture on video domain has not been explored, due to complex spatial-temporal modeling with large computation burden. To fill this gap, we present an efficient self-attention free backbone, namely MorphMLP, which flexibly leverages the concise Fully-Connected (FC) layer for video representation learning. Specifically, a MorphMLP block consists of two key layers in sequence, i.e., MorphFC_s and MorphFC_t, for spatial and temporal modeling respectively. MorphFC_s can effectively capture core semantics in each frame, by progressive token interaction along both height and width dimensions. Alternatively, MorphFC_t can adaptively learn long-term dependency over frames, by temporal token aggregation on each spatial location. With such multi-dimension and multi-scale factorization, our MorphMLP block can achieve a great accuracy-computation balance. Finally, we evaluate our MorphMLP on a number of popular video benchmarks. Compared with the recent state-of-the-art models, MorphMLP significantly reduces computation but with better accuracy, e.g., MorphMLP-S only uses 50% GFLOPs of Video**Swin**-T but achieves 0.9% top-1 improvement on Kinetics400, under ImageNet1K pretraining. MorphMLP-B only uses 43% GFLOPs of MViT-B but achieves 2.4% top-1 improvement on SSV2, even though MorphMLP-B is pretrained on ImageNet1K while MViT-B is pretrained on Kinetics400. Moreover, our method adapted to the image domain outperforms previous SOTA MLP-Like architectures. Code is available at https://github.com/MTLab/MorphMLP.  
### GRAM: Generative Radiance Manifolds for 3D-Aware Image Generation. (arXiv:2112.08867v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Yu Deng, Jiaolong Yang, Jianfeng Xiang, Xin Tong
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08867](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08867)
> ABSTRACT  :  3D-aware image generative modeling aims to generate 3D-consistent images with explicitly controllable camera poses. Recent works have shown promising results by training neural radiance field (**NeRF**) generators on unstructured 2D images, but still can not generate highly-realistic images with fine details. A critical reason is that the high memory and computation cost of volumetric representation learning greatly restricts the number of point samples for radiance integration during training. Deficient sampling not only limits the expressive power of the generator to handle fine details but also impedes effective GAN training due to the noise caused by unstable Monte Carlo sampling. We propose a novel approach that regulates point sampling and radiance field learning on 2D manifolds, embodied as a set of learned implicit surfaces in the 3D volume. For each viewing ray, we calculate ray-surface intersections and accumulate their radiance generated by the network. By training and rendering such radiance manifolds, our generator can produce high quality images with realistic fine details and strong visual 3D consistency.  
### Privacy **Enhancement** for Cloud-Based Few-Shot Learning. (arXiv:2205.07864v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Requiring less data for accurate models, few-shot learning has shown robustness and generality in many application domains. However, deploying few-shot models in untrusted environments may inflict privacy concerns, e.g., attacks or adversaries that may breach the privacy of user-supplied data. This paper studies the privacy **enhancement** for the few-shot learning in an untrusted environment, e.g., the cloud, by establishing a novel privacy-preserved embedding space that preserves the privacy of data and maintains the accuracy of the model. We examine the impact of various image privacy methods such as blurring, pixelization, Gaussian noise, and differentially private pixelization (DP-Pix) on few-shot image classification and propose a method that learns privacy-preserved representation through the joint loss. The empirical results show how privacy-performance trade-off can be negotiated for privacy-enhanced few-shot learning.  
### GPS-GLASS: Learning **Night**time Semantic Segmentation Using Daytime Video and GPS data. (arXiv:2207.13297v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Hongjae Lee, Changwoo Han, Won Jung
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13297](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13297)
> ABSTRACT  :  Semantic segmentation for autonomous driving should be robust against various in-the-wild environments. **Night**time semantic segmentation is especially challenging due to a lack of annotated **night**time images and a large domain gap from daytime images with sufficient annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel GPS-based training framework for **night**time semantic segmentation. Given GPS-aligned pairs of daytime and **night**time images, we perform cross-domain correspondence matching to obtain pixel-level pseudo supervision. Moreover, we conduct flow estimation between daytime video frames and apply GPS-based scaling to acquire another pixel-level pseudo supervision. Using these pseudo supervisions with a confidence map, we train a **night**time semantic segmentation network without any annotation from **night**time images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several **night**time semantic segmentation datasets. Our source code is available at https://github.com/jimmy9704/GPS-GLASS.  
### SnowFormer: Scale-aware Transformer via Context Interaction for Single Image Desnowing. (arXiv:2208.09703v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Single image desnowing is a common yet challenging task. The complex snow degradations and diverse degradation scales demand strong representation ability. In order for the desnowing network to see various snow degradations and model the context interaction of local details and global information, we propose a powerful architecture dubbed as SnowFormer. First, it performs Scale-aware Feature Aggregation in the encoder to capture rich snow information of various degradations. Second, in order to tackle with large-scale degradation, it uses a novel Context Interaction Transformer Block in the decoder, which conducts context interaction of local details and global information from previous scale-aware feature aggregation in global context interaction. And the introduction of local context interaction improves recovery of scene details. Third, we devise a Heterogeneous Feature Projection Head which progressively fuse features from both the encoder and decoder and project the refined feature into the clean image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SnowFormer achieves significant improvements over other SOTA methods. Compared with SOTA single image desnowing method HDCW-Net, it boosts the PSNR metric by 9.2dB on the CSD testset. Moreover, it also achieves a 5.13dB increase in PSNR compared with general image **restoration** architecture NAFNet, which verifies the strong representation ability of our SnowFormer for snow removal task. The code is released in \url{https://github.com/Ephemeral182/SnowFormer}.

### Predicting microsatellite instability and key biomarkers in colorectal cancer from H&E-stained images: Achieving SOTA with Less Data using **Swin** Transformer. (arXiv:2208.10495v1 [q-bio.QM])
- Authors : Bangwei Guo, Jitendra Jonnagaddala, Hong Zhang, Xu Steven
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10495](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10495)
> ABSTRACT  :  Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed for predicting clinically relevant biomarkers, including microsatellite instability (MSI), for colorectal cancers (CRC). However, the current deep-learning networks are data-hungry and require large training datasets, which are often lacking in the medical domain. In this study, based on the latest Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (**Swin**-T), we developed an efficient workflow for biomarkers in CRC (MSI, hypermutation, chromosomal instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, BRAF, and TP53 mutation) that only required relatively small datasets, but achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) predictive performance. Our **Swin**-T workflow not only substantially outperformed published models in an intra-study cross-validation experiment using TCGA-CRC-DX dataset (N = 462), but also showed excellent generalizability in cross-study external validation and delivered a SOTA AUROC of 0.90 for MSI using the MCO dataset for training (N = 1065) and the same TCGA-CRC-DX for testing. Similar performance (AUROC=0.91) was achieved by Echle and colleagues using 8000 training samples (ResNet18) on the same testing dataset. **Swin**-T was extremely efficient using small training datasets and exhibits robust predictive performance with only 200-500 training samples. These data indicate that **Swin**-T may be 5-10 times more efficient than the current state-of-the-art algorithms for MSI based on ResNet18 and ShuffleNet. Furthermore, the **Swin**-T models showed promise as pre-screening tests for MSI status and BRAF mutation status, which could exclude and reduce the samples before the subsequent standard testing in a cascading diagnostic workflow to allow turnaround time reduction and cost saving.

### Joint Privacy **Enhancement** and Quantization in Federated Learning. (arXiv:2208.10888v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm for training machine learning models using possibly private data available at edge devices. The distributed operation of FL gives rise to challenges that are not encountered in centralized machine learning, including the need to preserve the privacy of the local datasets, and the communication load due to the repeated exchange of updated models. These challenges are often tackled individually via techniques that induce some distortion on the updated models, e.g., local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms and lossy compression. In this work we propose a method coined joint privacy **enhancement** and quantization (JoPEQ), which jointly implements lossy compression and privacy **enhancement** in FL settings. In particular, JoPEQ utilizes vector quantization based on random lattice, a universal compression technique whose byproduct distortion is statistically equivalent to additive noise. This distortion is leveraged to enhance privacy by augmenting the model updates with dedicated multivariate privacy preserving noise. We show that JoPEQ simultaneously quantizes data according to a required bit-rate while holding a desired privacy level, without notably affecting the utility of the learned model. This is shown via analytical LDP guarantees, distortion and convergence bounds derivation, and numerical studies. Finally, we empirically assert that JoPEQ demolishes common attacks known to exploit privacy leakage.  
### Regularized impurity reduction: Accurate decision trees with complexity guarantees. (arXiv:2208.10949v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Guangyi Zhang, Aristides Gionis

> ABSTRACT  :  Decision trees are popular classification models, providing high accuracy and intuitive explanations. However, as the tree size grows the model interpretability deteriorates. Traditional tree-induction algorithms, such as C4.5 and CART, rely on impurity-reduction functions that promote the discriminative power of each split. Thus, although these traditional methods are accurate in practice, there has been no theoretical guarantee that they will produce small trees. In this paper, we justify the use of a general family of impurity functions, including the popular functions of entropy and Gini-index, in scenarios where small trees are desirable, by showing that a simple **enhancement** can equip them with complexity guarantees. We consider a general setting, where objects to be classified are drawn from an arbitrary probability distribution, classification can be binary or multi-class, and splitting tests are associated with non-uniform costs. As a measure of tree complexity, we adopt the expected cost to classify an object drawn from the input distribution, which, in the uniform-cost case, is the expected number of tests. We propose a tree-induction algorithm that gives a logarithmic approximation guarantee on the tree complexity. This approximation factor is tight up to a constant factor under mild assumptions. The algorithm recursively selects a test that maximizes a greedy criterion defined as a weighted sum of three components. The first two components encourage the selection of tests that improve the balance and the cost-efficiency of the tree, respectively, while the third impurity-reduction component encourages the selection of more discriminative tests. As shown in our empirical evaluation, compared to the original heuristics, the enhanced algorithms strike an excellent balance between predictive accuracy and tree complexity.  
### **Enhancement** Encoding: A New Imbalanced Classification Approach via Encoding the Labels. (arXiv:2208.11056v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Chen Zhao
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11056](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11056)
> ABSTRACT  :  Class imbalance, which is also called long-tailed distribution, is a common problem in classification tasks based on machine learning. If it happens, the minority data will be overwhelmed by the majority, which presents quite a challenge for data science. To address the class imbalance problem, researchers have proposed lots of methods: some people make the data set balanced (SMOTE), some others refine the loss function (Focal Loss), and even someone has noticed the value of labels influences class-imbalanced learning (Yang and Xu. Rethinking the value of labels for improving class-imbalanced learning. In NeurIPS 2020), but no one changes the way to encode the labels of data yet. Nowadays, the most prevailing technique to encode labels is the one-hot encoding due to its nice performance in the general situation. However, it is not a good choice for imbalanced data, because the classifier will treat majority and minority samples equally. In this paper, we innovatively propose the **enhancement** encoding technique, which is specially designed for the imbalanced classification. The **enhancement** encoding combines re-weighting and cost-sensitiveness, which can reflect the difference between hard and easy (or minority and majority) classes. In order to reduce the number of validation samples and the computation cost, we also replace the confusion matrix with the novel soft-confusion matrix which works better with a small validation set. In the experiments, we evaluate the **enhancement** encoding with three different types of loss. And the results show that **enhancement** encoding is very effective to improve the performance of the network trained with imbalanced data. Particularly, the performance on minority classes is much better.  
### Asynchronous Execution of Heterogeneous Tasks in AI-coupled HPC Workflows. (arXiv:2208.11069v1 [cs.DC])
- Authors : Matteo Turilli, Shantenu Jha
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11069](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11069)
> ABSTRACT  :  Heterogeneous scientific workflows consist of numerous types of tasks and dependencies between them. Middleware capable of scheduling and submitting different task types across heterogeneous platforms must permit asynchronous execution of tasks for improved resource utilization, task throughput, and reduced makespan. In this paper we present an analysis of an important class of heterogeneous workflows, viz., AI-driven HPC workflows, to investigate asynchronous task execution requirements and properties. We model the degree of asynchronicity permitted for arbitrary workflows, and propose key metrics that can be used to determine qualitative benefits when employing asynchronous execution. Our experiments represent important scientific drivers, are performed at scale on Summit, and performance **enhancement**s due to asynchronous execution are consistent with our model.

> ABSTRACT  :  Causal graph, as an effective and powerful tool for causal modeling, is usually assumed as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, recommender systems usually involve feedback loops, defined as the cyclic process of recommending items, incorporating user feedback in model updates, and repeating the procedure. As a result, it is important to incorporate loops into the causal graphs to accurately model the dynamic and iterative data generation process for recommender systems. However, feedback loops are not always beneficial since over time they may encourage more and more narrowed content **exposure**, which if left unattended, may results in echo chambers. As a result, it is important to understand when the recommendations will lead to echo chambers and how to mitigate echo chambers without hurting the recommendation performance.    In this paper, we design a causal graph with loops to describe the dynamic process of recommendation. We then take Markov process to analyze the mathematical properties of echo chamber such as the conditions that lead to echo chambers. Inspired by the theoretical analysis, we propose a Dynamic Causal Collaborative Filtering ($\partial$CCF) model, which estimates users' post-intervention preference on items based on back-door adjustment and mitigates echo chamber with counterfactual reasoning. Multiple experiments are conducted on real-world datasets and results show that our framework can mitigate echo chambers better than other state-of-the-art frameworks while achieving comparable recommendation performance with the base recommendation models.

### Learning Car Speed Using Inertial Sensors for Dead Reckoning Navigation. (arXiv:2205.07883v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)
- Authors : Maxim Freydin, Barak Or
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07883](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07883)
> ABSTRACT  :  A deep neural network (DNN) is trained to estimate the speed of a car driving in an urban area using as input a stream of measurements from a low-cost six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU). Three hours of data was collected by driving through the city of Ashdod, Israel in a car equipped with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) **real time** kinematic (RTK) positioning device and a synchronized IMU. Ground truth labels for the car speed were calculated using the position measurements obtained at the high rate of 50 Hz. A DNN architecture with long short-term memory layers is proposed to enable high-frequency speed estimation that accounts for previous inputs history and the nonlinear relation between speed, acceleration and angular velocity. A simplified aided dead reckoning localization scheme is formulated to assess the trained model which provides the speed pseudo-measurement. The trained model is shown to substantially improve the position accuracy during a 4 minutes drive without the use of GNSS position updates.

> ABSTRACT  :  We present formulation and open-source tools to achieve in-material model predictive control of sensor/actuator systems using learned forward kinematics and on-device computation. Microcontroller units (MCUs) that compute the prediction and control task while colocated with the sensors and actuators enable in-material untethered behaviors. In this approach, small parameter size neural network models learn forward kinematics offline. Our open-source compiler, nn4mc, generates code to offload these predictions onto MCUs. A Newton-Raphson solver then computes the control input in **real time**. We first benchmark this nonlinear control approach against a PID controller on a mass-spring-damper simulation. We then study experimental results on two experimental rigs with different sensing, actuation and computational hardware: a tendon-based platform with embedded LightLace sensors and a HASEL-based platform with magnetic sensors. Experimental results indicate effective high-bandwidth tracking of reference paths (greater than or equal to 120 Hz) with a small memory footprint (less than or equal to 6.4% of flash memory). The measured path following error does not exceed 2mm in the tendon-based platform. The simulated path following error does not exceed 1mm in the HASEL-based platform. The mean power consumption of this approach in an ARM Cortex-M4f device is 45.4 mW. This control approach is also compatible with Tensorflow Lite models and equivalent on-device code. In-material intelligence enables a new class of composites that infuse autonomy into structures and systems with refined artificial proprioception.

> ABSTRACT  :  Deep neural network based object detectors are continuously evolving and are used in a multitude of applications, each having its own set of requirements. While safety-critical applications need high accuracy and reliability, low-latency tasks need resource and energy-efficient networks. **Real-time** detectors, which are a necessity in high-impact real-world applications, are continuously proposed, but they overemphasize the improvements in accuracy and speed while other capabilities such as versatility, robustness, resource and energy efficiency are omitted. A reference benchmark for existing networks does not exist, nor does a standard evaluation guideline for designing new networks, which results in ambiguous and inconsistent comparisons. We, thus, conduct a comprehensive study on multiple real-time detectors (anchor-, keypoint-, and transformer-based) on a wide range of datasets and report results on an extensive set of metrics. We also study the impact of variables such as image size, anchor dimensions, confidence thresholds, and architecture layers on the overall performance. We analyze the robustness of detection networks against distribution shifts, natural corruptions, and adversarial attacks. Also, we provide a calibration analysis to gauge the reliability of the predictions. Finally, to highlight the real-world impact, we conduct two unique case studies, on autonomous driving and healthcare applications. To further gauge the capability of networks in critical real-time applications, we report the performance after deploying the detection networks on edge devices. Our extensive empirical study can act as a guideline for the industrial community to make an informed choice on the existing networks. We also hope to inspire the research community towards a new direction in the design and evaluation of networks that focuses on a bigger and holistic overview for a far-reaching impact.  
### Asynchronous Execution of Heterogeneous Tasks in AI-coupled HPC Workflows. (arXiv:2208.11069v1 [cs.DC])

> ABSTRACT  :  Heterogeneous scientific workflows consist of numerous types of tasks and dependencies between them. Middleware capable of scheduling and submitting different task types across heterogeneous platforms must permit asynchronous execution of tasks for improved resource utilization, task throughput, and reduced makespan. In this paper we present an analysis of an important class of heterogeneous workflows, viz., AI-driven HPC workflows, to investigate asynchronous task execution requirements and properties. We model the degree of asynchronicity permitted for arbitrary workflows, and propose key metrics that can be used to determine qualitative benefits when employing asynchronous execution. Our experiments represent important scientific drivers, are performed at scale on Summit, and performance **enhancement**s due to asynchronous execution are consistent with our model.

> ABSTRACT  :  Causal graph, as an effective and powerful tool for causal modeling, is usually assumed as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, recommender systems usually involve feedback loops, defined as the cyclic process of recommending items, incorporating user feedback in model updates, and repeating the procedure. As a result, it is important to incorporate loops into the causal graphs to accurately model the dynamic and iterative data generation process for recommender systems. However, feedback loops are not always beneficial since over time they may encourage more and more narrowed content **exposure**, which if left unattended, may results in echo chambers. As a result, it is important to understand when the recommendations will lead to echo chambers and how to mitigate echo chambers without hurting the recommendation performance.    In this paper, we design a causal graph with loops to describe the dynamic process of recommendation. We then take Markov process to analyze the mathematical properties of echo chamber such as the conditions that lead to echo chambers. Inspired by the theoretical analysis, we propose a Dynamic Causal Collaborative Filtering ($\partial$CCF) model, which estimates users' post-intervention preference on items based on back-door adjustment and mitigates echo chamber with counterfactual reasoning. Multiple experiments are conducted on real-world datasets and results show that our framework can mitigate echo chambers better than other state-of-the-art frameworks while achieving comparable recommendation performance with the base recommendation models.  
### Learning Car Speed Using Inertial Sensors for Dead Reckoning Navigation. (arXiv:2205.07883v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  A deep neural network (DNN) is trained to estimate the speed of a car driving in an urban area using as input a stream of measurements from a low-cost six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU). Three hours of data was collected by driving through the city of Ashdod, Israel in a car equipped with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) **real time** kinematic (RTK) positioning device and a synchronized IMU. Ground truth labels for the car speed were calculated using the position measurements obtained at the high rate of 50 Hz. A DNN architecture with long short-term memory layers is proposed to enable high-frequency speed estimation that accounts for previous inputs history and the nonlinear relation between speed, acceleration and angular velocity. A simplified aided dead reckoning localization scheme is formulated to assess the trained model which provides the speed pseudo-measurement. The trained model is shown to substantially improve the position accuracy during a 4 minutes drive without the use of GNSS position updates.
