> ABSTRACT  :  Feature fusion modules from encoder and self-attention module have been adopted in semantic segmentation. However, the computation of these modules is costly and has operational limitations in real-time environments. In addition, segmentation performance is limited in autonomous driving environments with a lot of contextual information perpendicular to the road surface, such as people, buildings, and general objects. In this paper, we propose an efficient feature fusion method, Feature Fusion with Different Norms (FFDN) that utilizes rich global context of multi-level scale and vertical pooling module before self-attention that preserves most contextual information while reducing the complexity of global context encoding in the vertical direction. By doing this, we could handle the properties of representation in global space and reduce additional computational cost. In addition, we analyze low performance in challenging cases including small and vertically featured objects. We achieve the mean Interaction of-union(mIoU) of 73.1 and the Frame Per Second(FPS) of 191, which are comparable results with state-of-the-arts on Cityscapes test datasets.

> ABSTRACT  :  Recently, Transformer-based image **restoration** networks have achieved promising improvements over convolutional neural networks due to parameter-independent global interactions. To lower computational cost, existing works generally limit self-attention computation within non-overlapping windows. However, each group of tokens are always from a dense area of the image. This is considered as a dense attention strategy since the interactions of tokens are restrained in dense regions. Obviously, this strategy could result in restricted receptive fields. To address this issue, we propose Attention Retractable Transformer (ART) for image **restoration**, which presents both dense and sparse attention modules in the network. The sparse attention module allows tokens from sparse areas to interact and thus provides a wider receptive field. Furthermore, the alternating application of dense and sparse attention modules greatly enhances representation ability of Transformer while providing retractable attention on the input image.We conduct extensive experiments on image super-resolution, denoising, and JPEG compression artifact reduction tasks. Experimental results validate that our proposed ART outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets both quantitatively and visually. We also provide code and models at the website https://github.com/gladzhang/ART.

> ABSTRACT  :  Anatomical structures such as blood vessels in contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) images can be challenging to segment due to the variability in contrast medium diffusion. The combined use of ceCT and contrast-free (CT) CT images can improve the segmentation performances, but at the cost of a double radiation **exposure**. To limit the radiation dose, generative models could be used to synthesize one modality, instead of acquiring it. The CycleGAN approach has recently attracted particular attention because it alleviates the need for paired data that are difficult to obtain. Despite the great performances demonstrated in the literature, limitations still remain when dealing with 3D volumes generated slice by slice from unpaired datasets with different fields of view. We present an extension of CycleGAN to generate high fidelity images, with good structural consistency, in this context. We leverage anatomical constraints and automatic region of interest selection by adapting the Self-Supervised Body Regressor. These constraints enforce anatomical consistency and allow feeding anatomically-paired input images to the algorithm. Results show qualitative and quantitative improvements, compared to stateof-the-art methods, on the translation task between ceCT and CT images (and vice versa).

> ABSTRACT  :  Mixture of Experts (MoE) is able to scale up vision transformers effectively. However, it requires prohibiting computation resources to train a large MoE transformer. In this paper, we propose Residual Mixture of Experts (RMoE), an efficient training pipeline for MoE vision transformers on downstream tasks, such as segmentation and detection. RMoE achieves comparable results with the upper-bound MoE training, while only introducing minor additional training cost than the lower-bound non-MoE training pipelines. The efficiency is supported by our key observation: the weights of an MoE transformer can be factored into an input-independent core and an input-dependent residual. Compared with the weight core, the weight residual can be efficiently trained with much less computation resource, e.g., finetuning on the downstream data. We show that, compared with the current MoE training pipeline, we get comparable results while saving over 30% training cost. When compared with state-of-the-art non- MoE transformers, such as **Swin**-T / CvT-13 / **Swin**-L, we get +1.1 / 0.9 / 1.0 mIoU gain on ADE20K segmentation and +1.4 / 1.6 / 0.6 AP gain on MS-COCO object detection task with less than 3% additional training cost.  
### Distilling Style from Image Pairs for Global Forward and Inverse **Tone Mapping**. (arXiv:2209.15165v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Many image **enhancement** or editing operations, such as forward and inverse tone mapping or color grading, do not have a unique solution, but instead a range of solutions, each representing a different style. Despite this, existing learning-based methods attempt to learn a unique mapping, disregarding this style. In this work, we show that information about the style can be distilled from collections of image pairs and encoded into a 2- or 3-dimensional vector. This gives us not only an efficient representation but also an interpretable latent space for editing the image style. We represent the global color mapping between a pair of images as a custom normalizing flow, conditioned on a polynomial basis of the pixel color. We show that such a network is more effective than PCA or VAE at encoding image style in low-dimensional space and lets us obtain an accuracy close to 40 dB, which is about 7-10 dB improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.

### Wheel Impact Test by Deep Learning: Prediction of Location and Magnitude of Maximum Stress. (arXiv:2210.01126v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  The impact performance of the wheel during wheel development must be ensured through a wheel impact test for vehicle safety. However, manufacturing and testing a real wheel take a significant amount of time and money because developing an optimal wheel design requires numerous iterative processes of modifying the wheel design and verifying the safety performance. Accordingly, the actual wheel impact test has been replaced by computer simulations, such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA), but it still requires high computational costs for modeling and analysis. Moreover, FEA experts are needed. This study presents an aluminum road wheel impact performance prediction model based on deep learning that replaces the computationally expensive and time-consuming 3D FEA. For this purpose, 2D disk-view wheel image data, 3D wheel voxel data, and barrier mass value used for wheel impact test are utilized as the inputs to predict the magnitude of maximum von Mises stress, corresponding location, and the stress distribution of 2D disk-view. The wheel impact performance prediction model can replace the impact test in the early wheel development stage by predicting the impact performance in **real time** and can be used without domain knowledge. The time required for the wheel development process can be shortened through this mechanism.  
### Enriching Vulnerability Reports Through Automated and Augmented Description Summarization. (arXiv:2210.01260v1 [cs.CR])
- Authors : Hattan Althebeiti, David Mohaisen

> ABSTRACT  :  Security incidents and data breaches are increasing rapidly, and only a fraction of them is being reported. Public vulnerability databases, e.g., national vulnerability database (NVD) and common vulnerability and **exposure** (CVE), have been leading the effort in documenting vulnerabilities and sharing them to aid defenses. Both are known for many issues, including brief vulnerability descriptions. Those descriptions play an important role in communicating the vulnerability information to security analysts in order to develop the appropriate countermeasure. Many resources provide additional information about vulnerabilities, however, they are not utilized to boost public repositories. In this paper, we devise a pipeline to augment vulnerability description through third party reference (hyperlink) scrapping. To normalize the description, we build a natural language summarization pipeline utilizing a pretrained language model that is fine-tuned using labeled instances and evaluate its performance against both human evaluation (golden standard) and computational metrics, showing initial promising results in terms of summary fluency, completeness, correctness, and understanding.  
### Public Transit Arrival Prediction: a Seq2Seq RNN Approach. (arXiv:2210.01655v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Nancy Bhutani, Soumen Pachal, Avinash Achar
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01655](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01655)
> ABSTRACT  :  Arrival/Travel times for public transit exhibit variability on account of factors like seasonality, dwell times at bus stops, traffic signals, travel demand fluctuation etc. The developing world in particular is plagued by additional factors like lack of lane discipline, excess vehicles, diverse modes of transport and so on. This renders the bus arrival time prediction (BATP) to be a challenging problem especially in the developing world. A novel data-driven model based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is proposed for BATP (in real-time) in the current work. The model intelligently incorporates both spatial and temporal correlations in a unique (non-linear) fashion distinct from existing approaches. In particular, we propose a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based Encoder-Decoder(ED) OR Seq2Seq RNN model (originally introduced for language translation) for BATP. The geometry of the dynamic **real time** BATP problem enables a nice fit with the Encoder-Decoder based RNN structure. We feed relevant additional synchronized inputs (from previous trips) at each step of the decoder (a feature classically unexplored in machine translation applications). Further motivated from accurately modelling congestion influences on travel time prediction, we additionally propose to use a bidirectional layer at the decoder (something unexplored in other time-series based ED application contexts). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on real field data collected from challenging traffic conditions. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms diverse existing state-of-art data-driven approaches proposed for the same problem.

### Phase-Aware Deep Speech **Enhancement**: It's All About The Frame Length. (arXiv:2203.16222v2 [eess.AS] UPDATED)
- Authors : Tal Peer, Timo Gerkmann
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16222](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16222)
> ABSTRACT  :  Algorithmic latency in speech processing is dominated by the frame length used for Fourier analysis, which in turn limits the achievable performance of magnitude-centric approaches. As previous studies suggest the importance of phase grows with decreasing frame length, this work presents a systematical study on the contribution of phase and magnitude in modern Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based speech **enhancement** at different frame lengths. Results indicate that DNNs can successfully estimate phase when using short frames, with similar or better overall performance compared to using longer frames. Thus, interestingly, modern phase-aware DNNs allow for low-latency speech **enhancement** at high quality.  
### Do language models make human-like predictions about the coreferents of Italian anaphoric zero pronouns?. (arXiv:2208.14554v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)
- Authors : 
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14554](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14554)
> ABSTRACT  :  Some languages allow arguments to be omitted in certain contexts. Yet human language comprehenders reliably infer the intended referents of these zero pronouns, in part because they construct expectations about which referents are more likely. We ask whether Neural Language Models also extract the same expectations. We test whether 12 contemporary language models display expectations that reflect human behavior when exposed to sentences with zero pronouns from five behavioral experiments conducted in Italian by Carminati (2005). We find that three models - XGLM 2.9B, 4.5B, and 7.5B - capture the human behavior from all the experiments, with others successfully modeling some of the results. This result suggests that human expectations about coreference can be derived from **exposure** to language, and also indicates features of language models that allow them to better reflect human behavior.

### MetaTrader: An Reinforcement Learning Approach Integrating Diverse Policies for Portfolio Optimization. (arXiv:2210.01774v1 [q-fin.CP])

> ABSTRACT  :  Portfolio management is a fundamental problem in finance. It involves periodic reallocations of assets to maximize the expected returns within an appropriate level of risk **exposure**. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been considered a promising approach to solving this problem owing to its strong capability in sequential decision making. However, due to the non-stationary nature of financial markets, applying RL techniques to portfolio optimization remains a challenging problem. Extracting trading knowledge from various expert strategies could be helpful for agents to accommodate the changing markets. In this paper, we propose MetaTrader, a novel two-stage RL-based approach for portfolio management, which learns to integrate diverse trading policies to adapt to various market conditions. In the first stage, MetaTrader incorporates an imitation learning objective into the reinforcement learning framework. Through imitating different expert demonstrations, MetaTrader acquires a set of trading policies with great diversity. In the second stage, MetaTrader learns a meta-policy to recognize the market conditions and decide on the most proper learned policy to follow. We evaluate the proposed approach on three real-world index datasets and compare it to state-of-the-art baselines. The empirical results demonstrate that MetaTrader significantly outperforms those baselines in balancing profits and risks. Furthermore, thorough ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the components in the proposed approach.
