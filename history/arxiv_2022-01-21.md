> ABSTRACT  :  Vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated great potential in various visual tasks, but suffer from expensive computational and memory cost problems when deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we introduce a ternary vision transformer (TerViT) to ternarize the weights in ViTs, which are challenged by the large loss surface gap between real-valued and ternary parameters. To address the issue, we introduce a progressive training scheme by first training 8-bit transformers and then TerViT, and achieve a better optimization than conventional methods. Furthermore, we introduce channel-wise ternarization, by partitioning each matrix to different channels, each of which is with an unique distribution and ternarization interval. We apply our methods to popular DeiT and **Swin** backbones, and extensive results show that we can achieve competitive performance. For example, TerViT can quantize **Swin**-S to 13.1MB model size while achieving above 79% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset.

> ABSTRACT  :  A real-time elemental image array (EIA) generation method which does not sacrifice accuracy nor rely on high-performance hardware is developed, through raytracing and pre-stored voxel-pixel lookup table (LUT). Benefiting from both offline and online working flow, experiments verified the effectiveness.

### **Enhancement** or Super-Resolution: Learning-based Adaptive Video Streaming with Client-Side Video Processing. (arXiv:2201.08197v1 [eess.SY])

> ABSTRACT  :  The rapid development of multimedia and communication technology has resulted in an urgent need for high-quality video streaming. However, robust video streaming under fluctuating network conditions and heterogeneous client computing capabilities remains a challenge. In this paper, we consider an **enhancement**-enabled video streaming network under a time-varying wireless network and limited computation capacity. "**Enhancement**" means that the client can improve the quality of the downloaded video segments via image processing modules. We aim to design a joint bitrate adaptation and client-side **enhancement** algorithm toward maximizing the quality of experience (QoE). We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework, named ENAVS. As video streaming quality is mainly affected by video compression, we demonstrate that the video **enhancement** algorithm outperforms the super-resolution algorithm in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and frames per second, suggesting a better solution for client processing in video streaming. Ultimately, we implement ENAVS and demonstrate extensive testbed results under real-world bandwidth traces and videos. The simulation shows that ENAVS is capable of delivering 5%-14% more QoE under the same bandwidth and computing power conditions as conventional ABR streaming.
