### RestoreDet: Degradation Equivariant Representation for Object Detection in Low Resolution Images. (arXiv:2201.02314v1 [eess.IV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Image **restoration** algorithms such as super resolution (SR) are indispensable pre-processing modules for object detection in degraded images. However, most of these algorithms assume the degradation is fixed and known a priori. When the real degradation is unknown or differs from assumption, both the pre-processing module and the consequent high-level task such as object detection would fail. Here, we propose a novel framework, RestoreDet, to detect objects in degraded low resolution images. RestoreDet utilizes the downsampling degradation as a kind of transformation for self-supervised signals to explore the equivariant representation against various resolutions and other degradation conditions. Specifically, we learn this intrinsic visual structure by encoding and decoding the degradation transformation from a pair of original and randomly degraded images. The framework could further take the advantage of advanced SR architectures with an arbitrary resolution restoring decoder to reconstruct the original correspondence from the degraded input image. Both the representation learning and object detection are optimized jointly in an end-to-end training fashion. RestoreDet is a generic framework that could be implemented on any mainstream object detection architectures. The extensive experiment shows that our framework based on CenterNet has achieved superior performance compared with existing methods when facing variant degradation situations. Our code would be released soon.  
### Cross-SRN: Structure-Preserving Super-Resolution Network with Cross Convolution. (arXiv:2201.01458v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  It is challenging to restore low-resolution (LR) images to super-resolution (SR) images with correct and clear details. Existing deep learning works almost neglect the inherent structural information of images, which acts as an important role for visual perception of SR results. In this paper, we design a hierarchical feature exploitation network to probe and preserve structural information in a multi-scale feature fusion manner. First, we propose a cross convolution upon traditional edge detectors to localize and represent edge features. Then, cross convolution blocks (CCBs) are designed with feature normalization and channel attention to consider the inherent correlations of features. Finally, we leverage multi-scale feature fusion group (MFFG) to embed the cross convolution blocks and develop the relations of structural features in different scales hierarchically, invoking a lightweight structure-preserving network named as Cross-SRN. Experimental results demonstrate the Cross-SRN achieves competitive or superior **restoration** performances against the state-of-the-art methods with accurate and clear structural details. Moreover, we set a criterion to select images with rich structural textures. The proposed Cross-SRN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the selected benchmark, which demonstrates that our network has a significant advantage in preserving edges.

### Learnable Strategies for **Bilateral** Agent Negotiation over Multiple Issues. (arXiv:2009.08302v2 [cs.MA] UPDATED)
- Authors : Pallavi Bagga, Nicola Paoletti, Kostas Stathis
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08302](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08302)
> ABSTRACT  :  We present a novel **bilateral** negotiation model that allows a self-interested agent to learn how to negotiate over multiple issues in the presence of user preference uncertainty. The model relies upon interpretable strategy templates representing the tactics the agent should employ during the negotiation and learns template parameters to maximize the average utility received over multiple negotiations, thus resulting in optimal bid acceptance and generation. Our model also uses deep reinforcement learning to evaluate threshold utility values, for those tactics that require them, thereby deriving optimal utilities for every environment state. To handle user preference uncertainty, the model relies on a stochastic search to find user model that best agrees with a given partial preference profile. Multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria decision-making methods are applied at negotiation time to generate Pareto-optimal outcomes thereby increasing the number of successful (win-win) negotiations. Rigorous experimental evaluations show that the agent employing our model outperforms the winning agents of the 10th Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC'19) in terms of individual as well as social-welfare utilities.
