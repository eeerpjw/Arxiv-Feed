> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we present a dynamic convolution kernel (DCK) strategy for convolutional neural networks. Using a fully convolutional network with the proposed DCKs, high-quality talking-face video can be generated from multi-modal sources (i.e., unmatched audio and video) in **real time**, and our trained model is robust to different identities, head postures, and input audios. Our proposed DCKs are specially designed for audio-driven talking face video generation, leading to a simple yet effective end-to-end system. We also provide a theoretical analysis to interpret why DCKs work. Experimental results show that our method can generate high-quality talking-face video with background at 60 fps. Comparison and evaluation between our method and the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of our method.

> ABSTRACT  :  Near infrared (NIR) imaging has been widely applied in **low-light** imaging scenarios; however, it is difficult for human and algorithms to perceive the real scene in the colorless NIR domain. While Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been widely employed in various image colorization tasks, it is challenging for a direct mapping mechanism, such as a conventional GAN, to transform an image from the NIR to the RGB domain with correct semantic reasoning, well-preserved textures, and vivid color combinations concurrently. In this work, we propose a novel Attention-based NIR image colorization framework via Adaptive Fusion of Semantic and Texture clues, aiming at achieving these goals within the same framework. The tasks of texture transfer and semantic reasoning are carried out in two separate network blocks. Specifically, the Texture Transfer Block (TTB) aims at extracting texture features from the NIR image's Laplacian component and transferring them for subsequent color fusion. The Semantic Reasoning Block (SRB) extracts semantic clues and maps the NIR pixel values to the RGB domain. Finally, a Fusion Attention Block (FAB) is proposed to adaptively fuse the features from the two branches and generate an optimized colorization result. In order to enhance the network's learning capacity in semantic reasoning as well as mapping precision in texture transfer, we have proposed the Residual Coordinate Attention Block (RCAB), which incorporates coordinate attention into a residual learning framework, enabling the network to capture long-range dependencies along the channel direction and meanwhile precise positional information can be preserved along spatial directions. RCAB is also incorporated into FAB to facilitate accurate texture alignment during fusion. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art NIR image colorization methods.

> ABSTRACT  :  Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing learning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated medical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts, and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of 90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to previous best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, showing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream tasks, such as medical image synthesis, **enhancement**, and registration.  
### Towards Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Federated Representation Learning. (arXiv:2109.14611v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14611](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14611)
> ABSTRACT  :  This paper investigates the feasibility of federated representation learning under the constraints of communication cost and privacy protection. Existing works either conduct annotation-guided local training which requires frequent communication or aggregates the client models via weight averaging which has potential risks of privacy **exposure**. To tackle the above problems, we first identify that self-supervised contrastive local training is robust against the non-identically distributed data, which provides the feasibility of longer local training and thus reduces the communication cost. Then based on the aforementioned robustness, we propose a novel Federated representation Learning framework with Ensemble Similarity Distillation~(FLESD) that utilizes this robustness. At each round of communication, the server first gathers a fraction of the clients' inferred similarity matrices on a public dataset. Then it ensembles the similarity matrices and train the global model via similarity distillation. We verify the effectiveness of FLESD by a series of empirical experiments and show that, despite stricter constraints, it achieves comparable results under multiple settings on multiple datasets.  
### Counteracting **Dark** Web Text-Based CAPTCHA with Generative Adversarial Learning for Proactive Cyber Threat Intelligence. (arXiv:2201.02799v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Automated monitoring of **dark** web (DW) platforms on a large scale is the first step toward developing proactive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). While there are efficient methods for collecting data from the surface web, large-scale **dark** web data collection is often hindered by anti-crawling measures. In particular, text-based CAPTCHA serves as the most prevalent and prohibiting type of these measures in the **dark** web. Text-based CAPTCHA identifies and blocks automated crawlers by forcing the user to enter a combination of hard-to-recognize alphanumeric characters. In the **dark** web, CAPTCHA images are meticulously designed with additional background noise and variable character length to prevent automated CAPTCHA breaking. Existing automated CAPTCHA breaking methods have difficulties in overcoming these **dark** web challenges. As such, solving **dark** web text-based CAPTCHA has been relying heavily on human involvement, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we propose a novel framework for automated breaking of **dark** web CAPTCHA to facilitate **dark** web data collection. This framework encompasses a novel generative method to recognize **dark** web text-based CAPTCHA with noisy background and variable character length. To eliminate the need for human involvement, the proposed framework utilizes Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to counteract **dark** web background noise and leverages an enhanced character segmentation algorithm to handle CAPTCHA images with variable character length. Our proposed framework, DW-GAN, was systematically evaluated on multiple **dark** web CAPTCHA testbeds. DW-GAN significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art benchmark methods on all datasets, achieving over 94.4% success rate on a carefully collected real-world **dark** web dataset...

### Improving Clinical Diagnosis Performance with Automated X-ray Scan Quality **Enhancement** Algorithms. (arXiv:2201.06250v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors : Sowmya Kamath

> ABSTRACT  :  In clinical diagnosis, diagnostic images that are obtained from the scanning devices serve as preliminary evidence for further investigation in the process of delivering quality healthcare. However, often the medical image may contain fault artifacts, introduced due to noise, blur and faulty equipment. The reason for this may be the low-quality or older scanning devices, the test environment or technicians lack of training etc; however, the net result is that the process of fast and reliable diagnosis is hampered. Resolving these issues automatically can have a significant positive impact in a hospital clinical workflow, where often, there is no other way but to work with faulty/older equipment or inadequately qualified radiology technicians. In this paper, automated image quality improvement approaches for adapted and benchmarked for the task of medical image super-resolution. During experimental evaluation on standard open datasets, the observations showed that certain algorithms perform better and show significant improvement in the diagnostic quality of medical scans, thereby enabling better visualization for human diagnostic purposes.  
### Joint denoising and **HDR** for RAW video sequences. (arXiv:2201.07066v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors : 
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07066](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07066)
> ABSTRACT  :  We propose a patch-based method for the simultaneous denoising and fusion of a sequence of RAW multi-exposed images. A spatio-temporal criterion is used to select similar patches along the sequence, and a weighted principal component analysis permits to both denoise and fuse the multi exposed data. The overall strategy permits to denoise and fuse the set of images without the need of recovering each denoised image in the multi-**exposure** set, leading to a very efficient procedure. Several experiments show that the proposed method permits to obtain state-of-the-art fusion results with real RAW data.

### The **Dark** Side of the Language: Pre-trained Transformers in the **Dark**Net. (arXiv:2201.05613v1 [cs.CL])

> ABSTRACT  :  Pre-trained Transformers are challenging human performances in many natural language processing tasks. The gigantic datasets used for pre-training seem to be the key for their success on existing tasks. In this paper, we explore how a range of pre-trained natural language understanding models perform on truly novel and unexplored data, provided by classification tasks over a **Dark**Net corpus. Surprisingly, results show that syntactic and lexical neural networks largely outperform pre-trained Transformers. This seems to suggest that pre-trained Transformers have serious difficulties in adapting to radically novel texts.  
### **Enhancement** of Healthcare Data Performance Metrics using Neural Network Machine Learning Algorithms. (arXiv:2201.05962v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  Patients are often encouraged to make use of wearable devices for remote collection and monitoring of health data. This adoption of wearables results in a significant increase in the volume of data collected and transmitted. The battery life of the devices is then quickly diminished due to the high processing requirements of the devices. Given the importance attached to medical data, it is imperative that all transmitted data adhere to strict integrity and availability requirements. Reducing the volume of healthcare data for network transmission may improve sensor battery life without compromising accuracy. There is a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy which can be controlled by adjusting the sampling and transmission rates. This paper demonstrates that machine learning can be used to analyse complex health data metrics such as the accuracy and efficiency of data transmission to overcome the trade-off problem. The study uses time series nonlinear autoregressive neural network algorithms to enhance both data metrics by taking fewer samples to transmit. The algorithms were tested with a standard heart rate dataset to compare their accuracy and efficiency. The result showed that the Levenbery-Marquardt algorithm was the best performer with an efficiency of 3.33 and accuracy of 79.17%, which is similar to other algorithms accuracy but demonstrates improved efficiency. This proves that machine learning can improve without sacrificing a metric over the other compared to the existing methods with high efficiency.  
### GearNet: Stepwise Dual Learning for Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation. (arXiv:2201.06001v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Renchunzi Xie, Hongxin Wei, Lei Feng, Bo An
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06001](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06001)
> ABSTRACT  :  This paper studies weakly supervised domain adaptation(WSDA) problem, where we only have access to the source domain with noisy labels, from which we need to transfer useful information to the unlabeled target domain. Although there have been a few studies on this problem, most of them only exploit unidirectional relationships from the source domain to the target domain. In this paper, we propose a universal paradigm called GearNet to exploit **bilateral** relationships between the two domains. Specifically, we take the two domains as different inputs to train two models alternately, and asymmetrical Kullback-Leibler loss is used for selectively matching the predictions of the two models in the same domain. This interactive learning schema enables implicit label noise canceling and exploits correlations between the source and target domains. Therefore, our GearNet has the great potential to boost the performance of a wide range of existing WSDL methods. Comprehensive experimental results show that the performance of existing methods can be significantly improved by equipping with our GearNet.

> ABSTRACT  :  Search systems control the **exposure** of ranked content to searchers. In many cases, creators value not only the **exposure** of their content but, moreover, an understanding of the specific searches where the content is surfaced. The problem of identifying which queries expose a given piece of content in the ranking results is an important and relatively under-explored search transparency challenge. Exposing queries are useful for quantifying various issues of search bias, privacy, data protection, security, and search engine optimization.    Exact identification of exposing queries in a given system is computationally expensive, especially in dynamic contexts such as web search. We explore the feasibility of approximate exposing query identification (EQI) as a retrieval task by reversing the role of queries and documents in two classes of search systems: dense dual-encoder models and traditional BM25 models. We then propose how this approach can be improved through metric learning over the retrieval embedding space. We further derive an evaluation metric to measure the quality of a ranking of exposing queries, as well as conducting an empirical analysis focusing on various practical aspects of approximate EQI. Overall, our work contributes a novel conception of transparency in search systems and computational means of achieving it.

> ABSTRACT  :  The production of **dark** matter particles from confining **dark** sectors may lead to many novel experimental signatures. Depending on the details of the theory, **dark** quark production in proton-proton collisions could result in semivisible jets of particles: collimated sprays of **dark** hadrons of which only some are detectable by particle collider experiments. The experimental signature is characterised by the presence of reconstructed missing momentum collinear with the visible components of the jets. This complex topology is sensitive to detector inefficiencies and mis-reconstruction that generate artificial missing momentum. With this work, we propose a signal-agnostic strategy to reject ordinary jets and identify semivisible jets via anomaly detection techniques. A deep neural autoencoder network with jet substructure variables as input proves highly useful for analyzing anomalous jets. The study focuses on the semivisible jet signature; however, the technique can apply to any new physics model that predicts signatures with anomalous jets from non-SM particles.  
### Probabilistic Mass Mapping with Neural Score Estimation. (arXiv:2201.05561v2 [astro-ph.CO] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Weak lensing mass-mapping is a useful tool to access the full distribution of **dark** matter on the sky, but because of intrinsic galaxy ellipticies and finite fields/missing data, the recovery of **dark** matter maps constitutes a challenging ill-posed inverse problem. We introduce a novel methodology allowing for efficient sampling of the high-dimensional Bayesian posterior of the weak lensing mass-mapping problem, and relying on simulations for defining a fully non-Gaussian prior. We aim to demonstrate the accuracy of the method on simulations, and then proceed to applying it to the mass reconstruction of the HST/ACS COSMOS field. The proposed methodology combines elements of Bayesian statistics, analytic theory, and a recent class of Deep Generative Models based on Neural Score Matching. This approach allows us to do the following: 1) Make full use of analytic cosmological theory to constrain the 2pt statistics of the solution. 2) Learn from cosmological simulations any differences between this analytic prior and full simulations. 3) Obtain samples from the full Bayesian posterior of the problem for robust Uncertainty Quantification. We demonstrate the method on the $\kappa$TNG simulations and find that the posterior mean significantly outperfoms previous methods (Kaiser-Squires, Wiener filter, Sparsity priors) both on root-mean-square error and in terms of the Pearson correlation. We further illustrate the interpretability of the recovered posterior by establishing a close correlation between posterior convergence values and SNR of clusters artificially introduced into a field. Finally, we apply the method to the reconstruction of the HST/ACS COSMOS field and yield the highest quality convergence map of this field to date.

> ABSTRACT  :  Event cameras are a new type of sensors that are different from traditional cameras. Each pixel is triggered asynchronously by event. The trigger event is the change of the brightness irradiated on the pixel. If the increment or decrement of brightness is higher than a certain threshold, an event is output. Compared with traditional cameras, event cameras have the advantages of **high dynamic range** and no motion blur. Accumulating events to frames and using traditional SLAM algorithm is a direct and efficient way for event-based SLAM. Different event accumulator settings, such as slice method of event stream, processing method for no motion, using polarity or not, decay function and event contribution, can cause quite different accumulating results. We conducted the research on how to accumulate event frames to achieve a better event-based SLAM performance. For experiment verification, accumulated event frames are fed to the traditional SLAM system to construct an event-based SLAM system. Our strategy of setting event accumulator has been evaluated on the public dataset. The experiment results show that our method can achieve better performance in most sequences compared with the state-of-the-art event frame based SLAM algorithm. In addition, the proposed approach has been tested on a quadrotor UAV to show the potential of applications in real scenario. Code and results are open sourced to benefit the research community of event cameras.
