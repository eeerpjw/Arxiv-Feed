### Using maps to predict economic activity. (arXiv:2112.13850v1 [econ.GN])
- Authors : Imryoung Jeong, Hyunjoo Yang

> ABSTRACT  :  We introduce a novel machine learning approach to leverage historical and contemporary maps to systematically predict economic statistics. Remote sensing data have been used as reliable proxies for local economic activity. However, they have only become available in recent years, thus limiting their applicability for long-term analysis. Historical maps, on the other hand, date back several decades. Our simple algorithm extracts meaningful features from the maps based on their color compositions. The grid-level population predictions by our approach outperform the conventional CNN-based predictions using raw map images. It also predicts population better than other approaches using **night** light satellite images or land cover classifications as the input for predictions.

> ABSTRACT  :  With the rapid development of facial forgery techniques, forgery detection has attracted more and more attention due to security concerns. Existing approaches attempt to use frequency information to mine subtle artifacts under high-quality forged faces. However, the exploitation of frequency information is coarse-grained, and more importantly, their vanilla learning process struggles to extract fine-grained forgery traces. To address this issue, we propose a progressive **enhancement** learning framework to exploit both the RGB and fine-grained frequency clues. Specifically, we perform a fine-grained decomposition of RGB images to completely decouple the real and fake traces in the frequency space. Subsequently, we propose a progressive **enhancement** learning framework based on a two-branch network, combined with self-**enhancement** and mutual-**enhancement** modules. The self-**enhancement** module captures the traces in different input spaces based on spatial noise **enhancement** and channel attention. The Mutual-**enhancement** module concurrently enhances RGB and frequency features by communicating in the shared spatial dimension. The progressive **enhancement** process facilitates the learning of discriminative features with fine-grained face forgery clues. Extensive experiments on several datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art face forgery detection methods.  
### Towards Low Light Enhancement with RAW Images. (arXiv:2112.14022v1 [eess.IV])

> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we make the first benchmark effort to elaborate on the superiority of using RAW images in the **low light** **enhancement** and develop a novel alternative route to utilize RAW images in a more flexible and practical way. Inspired by a full consideration on the typical image processing pipeline, we are inspired to develop a new evaluation framework, Factorized Enhancement Model (FEM), which decomposes the properties of RAW images into measurable factors and provides a tool for exploring how properties of RAW images affect the **enhancement** performance empirically. The empirical benchmark results show that the Linearity of data and Exposure Time recorded in meta-data play the most critical role, which brings distinct performance gains in various measures over the approaches taking the sRGB images as input. With the insights obtained from the benchmark results in mind, a RAW-guiding Exposure Enhancement Network (REENet) is developed, which makes trade-offs between the advantages and inaccessibility of RAW images in real applications in a way of using RAW images only in the training phase. REENet projects sRGB images into linear RAW domains to apply constraints with corresponding RAW images to reduce the difficulty of modeling training. After that, in the testing phase, our REENet does not rely on RAW images. Experimental results demonstrate not only the superiority of REENet to state-of-the-art sRGB-based methods and but also the effectiveness of the RAW guidance and all components.

> ABSTRACT  :  Brain tumor analysis in MRI images is a significant and challenging issue because misdiagnosis can lead to death. Diagnosis and evaluation of brain tumors in the early stages increase the probability of successful treatment. However, the complexity and variety of tumors, shapes, and locations make their segmentation and classification complex. In this regard, numerous researchers have proposed brain tumor segmentation and classification methods. This paper presents an approach that simultaneously segments and classifies brain tumors in MRI images using a framework that contains MRI image **enhancement** and tumor region detection. Eventually, a network based on a multitask learning approach is proposed. Subjective and objective results indicate that the segmentation and classification results based on evaluation metrics are better or comparable to the state-of-the-art.  
### Multi-Head Deep Metric Learning Using Global and Local Representations. (arXiv:2112.14327v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Gang Qian, Allison Beach
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14327](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14327)
> ABSTRACT  :  Deep Metric Learning (DML) models often require strong local and global representations, however, effective integration of local and global features in DML model training is a challenge. DML models are often trained with specific loss functions, including pairwise-based and proxy-based losses. The pairwise-based loss functions leverage rich semantic relations among data points, however, they often suffer from slow convergence during DML model training. On the other hand, the proxy-based loss functions often lead to significant speedups in convergence during training, while the rich relations among data points are often not fully explored by the proxy-based losses. In this paper, we propose a novel DML approach to address these challenges. The proposed DML approach makes use of a hybrid loss by integrating the pairwise-based and the proxy-based loss functions to leverage rich data-to-data relations as well as fast convergence. Furthermore, the proposed DML approach utilizes both global and local features to obtain rich representations in DML model training. Finally, we also use the second-order attention for feature **enhancement** to improve accurate and efficient retrieval. In our experiments, we extensively evaluated the proposed DML approach on four public benchmarks, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks.  
### Deblurring via Stochastic Refinement. (arXiv:2112.02475v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Image deblurring is an ill-posed problem with multiple plausible solutions for a given input image. However, most existing methods produce a deterministic estimate of the clean image and are trained to minimize pixel-level distortion. These metrics are known to be poorly correlated with human perception, and often lead to unrealistic reconstructions. We present an alternative framework for blind deblurring based on conditional diffusion models. Unlike existing techniques, we train a stochastic sampler that refines the output of a deterministic predictor and is capable of producing a diverse set of plausible reconstructions for a given input. This leads to a significant improvement in perceptual quality over existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple standard benchmarks. Our predict-and-refine approach also enables much more efficient sampling compared to typical diffusion models. Combined with a carefully tuned network architecture and inference procedure, our method is competitive in terms of distortion metrics such as PSNR. These results show clear benefits of our diffusion-based method for deblurring and challenge the widely used strategy of producing a single, deterministic reconstruction.

### Seeing through a Black Box: Toward High-Quality Terahertz TomographicImaging via Multi-Scale Spatio-Spectral Image Fusion. (arXiv:2103.16932v2 [cs.MM] UPDATED)
- Authors : tai Su, Chun Hung, Hsuan Chao, Jen Yu, Hua Yang, Wen Lin

> ABSTRACT  :  Terahertz (THz) imaging has recently attracted significant attention thanks to its non-invasive, non-destructive, non-ionizing, material-classification, and ultra-fast nature for object exploration and inspection. However, its strong water absorption nature and low noise tolerance lead to undesired blurs and distortions of reconstructed THz images. The performances of existing **restoration** methods are highly constrained by the diffraction-limited THz signals. To address the problem, we propose a novel Subspace-and-Attention-guided **Restoration** Network (SARNet) that fuses multi-spectral features of a THz image for effective **restoration**. To this end, SARNet uses multi-scale branches to extract spatio-spectral features of amplitude and phase which are then fused via shared subspace projection and attention guidance. Here, we experimentally construct ultra-fast THz time-domain spectroscopy system covering a broad frequency range from 0.1 THz to 4 THz for building up temporal/spectral/spatial/phase/material THz database of hidden 3D objects. Complementary to a quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our SARNet model on 3D THz tomographic reconstruction
