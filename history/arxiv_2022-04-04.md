### Online panoptic 3D reconstruction as a Linear Assignment Problem. (arXiv:2204.00231v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  **Real-time** holistic scene understanding would allow machines to interpret their surrounding in a much more detailed manner than is currently possible. While panoptic image segmentation methods have brought image segmentation closer to this goal, this information has to be described relative to the 3D environment for the machine to be able to utilise it effectively. In this paper, we investigate methods for sequentially reconstructing static environments from panoptic image segmentations in 3D. We specifically target real-time operation: the algorithm must process data strictly online and be able to run at relatively fast frame rates. Additionally, the method should be scalable for environments large enough for practical applications. By applying a simple but powerful data-association algorithm, we outperform earlier similar works when operating purely online. Our method is also capable of reaching frame-rates high enough for real-time applications and is scalable to larger environments as well.

### Learning to Deblur using Light Field Generated and Real Defocus Images. (arXiv:2204.00367v1 [eess.IV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Defocus deblurring is a challenging task due to the spatially varying nature of defocus blur. While deep learning approach shows great promise in solving image **restoration** problems, defocus deblurring demands accurate training data that consists of all-in-focus and defocus image pairs, which is difficult to collect. Naive two-shot capturing cannot achieve pixel-wise correspondence between the defocused and all-in-focus image pairs. Synthetic aperture of light fields is suggested to be a more reliable way to generate accurate image pairs. However, the defocus blur generated from light field data is different from that of the images captured with a traditional digital camera. In this paper, we propose a novel deep defocus deblurring network that leverages the strength and overcomes the shortcoming of light fields. We first train the network on a light field-generated dataset for its highly accurate image correspondence. Then, we fine-tune the network using feature loss on another dataset collected by the two-shot method to alleviate the differences between the defocus blur exists in the two domains. This strategy is proved to be highly effective and able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on multiple test sets. Extensive ablation studies have been conducted to analyze the effect of each network module to the final performance.  
### DFNet: Enhance Aboslute Pose Regression with Direct Feature Matching. (arXiv:2204.00559v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  We introduce a camera relocalization pipeline that combines absolute pose regression (APR) and direct feature matching. Existing photometric-based methods have trouble on scenes with large photometric distortions, e.g. outdoor environments. By incorporating an **exposure**-adaptive novel view synthesis, our methods can successfully address the challenges. Moreover, by introducing domain-invariant feature matching, our solution can improve pose regression accuracy while using semi-supervised learning on unlabeled data. In particular, the pipeline consists of two components, Novel View Synthesizer and FeatureNet (DFNet). The former synthesizes novel views compensating for changes in **exposure** and the latter regresses camera poses and extracts robust features that bridge the domain gap between real images and synthetic ones. We show that domain invariant feature matching effectively enhances camera pose estimation both in indoor and outdoor scenes. Hence, our method achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy by outperforming existing single-image APR methods by as much as 56%, comparable to 3D structure-based methods.  
### **Night**-time Scene Parsing with a Large Real Dataset. (arXiv:2003.06883v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Although huge progress has been made on scene analysis in recent years, most existing works assume the input images to be in day-time with good lighting conditions. In this work, we aim to address the **night**-time scene parsing (NTSP) problem, which has two main challenges: 1) labeled **night**-time data are scarce, and 2) over- and under-**exposure**s may co-occur in the input **night**-time images and are not explicitly modeled in existing pipelines. To tackle the scarcity of **night**-time data, we collect a novel labeled dataset, named {\it **Night**City}, of 4,297 real **night**-time images with ground truth pixel-level semantic annotations. To our knowledge, **Night**City is the largest dataset for NTSP. In addition, we also propose an **exposure**-aware framework to address the NTSP problem through augmenting the segmentation process with explicitly learned **exposure** features. Extensive experiments show that training on **Night**City can significantly improve NTSP performances and that our **exposure**-aware model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, yielding top performances on our dataset as well as existing datasets.  
### CNN-Based Image Reconstruction Method for Ultrafast Ultrasound Imaging. (arXiv:2008.12750v3 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12750](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12750)
> ABSTRACT  :  Ultrafast ultrasound (US) revolutionized biomedical imaging with its capability of acquiring full-view frames at over 1 kHz, unlocking breakthrough modalities such as shear-wave elastography and functional US neuroimaging. Yet, it suffers from strong diffraction artifacts, mainly caused by grating lobes, side lobes, or edge waves. Multiple acquisitions are typically required to obtain a sufficient image quality, at the cost of a reduced frame rate. To answer the increasing demand for high-quality imaging from single unfocused acquisitions, we propose a two-step convolutional neural network (CNN)-based image reconstruction method, compatible with real-time imaging. A low-quality estimate is obtained by means of a backprojection-based operation, akin to conventional delay-and-sum beamforming, from which a high-quality image is restored using a residual CNN with multiscale and multichannel filtering properties, trained specifically to remove the diffraction artifacts inherent to ultrafast US imaging. To account for both the **high dynamic range** and the oscillating properties of radio frequency US images, we introduce the mean signed logarithmic absolute error (MSLAE) as a training loss function. Experiments were conducted with a linear transducer array, in single plane-wave (PW) imaging. Trainings were performed on a simulated dataset, crafted to contain a wide diversity of structures and echogenicities. Extensive numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach can reconstruct images from single PWs with a quality similar to that of gold-standard synthetic aperture imaging, on a dynamic range in excess of 60 dB. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that trainings carried out on simulated data perform well in experimental settings.

> ABSTRACT  :  The use of deep learning has successfully solved several problems in the field of medical imaging. Deep learning has been applied to the CT denoising problem successfully. However, the use of deep learning requires large amounts of data to train deep convolutional networks (CNNs). Moreover, due to large parameter count, such deep CNNs may cause unexpected results. In this study, we introduce a novel CT denoising framework, which has interpretable behaviour, and provides useful results with limited data. We employ **bilateral** filtering in both the projection and volume domains to remove noise. To account for non-stationary noise, we tune the $\sigma$ parameters of the volume for every projection view, and for every volume pixel. The tuning is carried out by two deep CNNs. Due to impracticality of labelling, the two deep CNNs are trained via a Deep-Q reinforcement learning task. The reward for the task is generated by using a custom reward function represented by a neural network. Our experiments were carried out on abdominal scans for the Mayo Clinic TCIA dataset, and the AAPM Low Dose CT Grand Challenge. Our denoising framework has excellent denoising performance increasing the PSNR from 28.53 to 28.93, and increasing the SSIM from 0.8952 to 0.9204. We outperform several state-of-the-art deep CNNs, which have several orders of magnitude higher number of parameters (p-value (PSNR) = 0.000, p-value (SSIM) = 0.000). Our method does not introduce any blurring, which is introduced by MSE loss based methods, or any deep learning artifacts, which are introduced by WGAN based models. Our ablation studies show that parameter tuning and using our reward network results in the best possible results.
