> ABSTRACT  :  Object detection using aerial drone imagery has received a great deal of attention in recent years. While visible light images are adequate for detecting objects in most scenarios, thermal cameras can extend the capabilities of object detection to **night**-time or occluded objects. As such, RGB and Infrared (IR) fusion methods for object detection are useful and important. One of the biggest challenges in applying deep learning methods to RGB/IR object detection is the lack of available training data for drone IR imagery, especially at **night**. In this paper, we develop several strategies for creating synthetic IR images using the AIRSim simulation engine and CycleGAN. Furthermore, we utilize an illumination-aware fusion framework to fuse RGB and IR images for object detection on the ground. We characterize and test our methods for both simulated and actual data. Our solution is implemented on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier running on an actual drone, requiring about 28 milliseconds of processing per RGB/IR image pair.

> ABSTRACT  :  Wearing masks is crucial to preventing the spread of potentially pathogen-containing droplets, especially amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, not all face coverings are equally effective and most experiments evaluating mask efficacy are very expensive and complex to operate. In this work, a novel, home-built, low-cost, and accurate metrology to visualize orally-generated fluid droplets has been developed. The project includes setup optimization, data collection, data analysis, and applications. The final materials chosen were quinine-containing tonic water, 397-402 nm wavelength UV tube lights, an iPhone and tripod, string, and a spray bottle. The experiment took place in a **dark** closet with a **dark** background. During data collection, the test subject first wets their mouth with an ingestible fluorescent liquid (tonic water) and speaks, sneezes, or coughs under UV **dark**light. The fluorescence from the tonic water droplets generated can be visualized, recorded by an iPhone 8+ camera in slo-mo (240 fps), and analyzed. The software VLC is used for frame separation and Fiji/ImageJ is used for image processing and analysis. The dependencies of oral fluid droplet generation and propagation on different phonics, the loudness of speech, and the type of expiratory event were studied in detail and established using the metrology developed. The efficacy of different types of masks was evaluated and correlated with fabric microstructures. All masks blocked droplets to varying extent. Masks with smaller-sized pores and thicker material were found to block the most droplets. This low-cost technique can be easily constructed at home using materials that total to a cost of less than $50. Despite the minimal cost, the method is very accurate and the data is quantifiable.

> ABSTRACT  :  The recently proposed MaskFormer \cite{maskformer} gives a refreshed perspective on the task of semantic segmentation: it shifts from the popular pixel-level classification paradigm to a mask-level classification method. In essence, it generates paired probabilities and masks corresponding to category segments and combines them during inference for the segmentation maps. The segmentation quality thus relies on how well the queries can capture the semantic information for categories and their spatial locations within the images. In our study, we find that per-mask classification decoder on top of a single-scale feature is not effective enough to extract reliable probability or mask. To mine for rich semantic information across the feature pyramid, we propose a transformer-based Pyramid Fusion Transformer (PFT) for per-mask approach semantic segmentation on top of multi-scale features. To efficiently utilize image features of different resolutions without incurring too much computational overheads, PFT uses a multi-scale transformer decoder with cross-scale inter-query attention to exchange complimentary information. Extensive experimental evaluations and ablations demonstrate the efficacy of our framework. In particular, we achieve a 3.2 mIoU improvement on COCO-Stuff 10K dataset with ResNet-101c compared to MaskFormer. Besides, on ADE20K validation set, our result with **Swin**-B backbone matches that of MaskFormer's with a much larger **Swin**-L backbone in both single-scale and multi-scale inference, achieving 54.1 mIoU and 55.3 mIoU respectively. Using a **Swin**-L backbone, we achieve 56.0 mIoU single-scale result on the ADE20K validation set and 57.2 multi-scale result, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on the dataset.

> ABSTRACT  :  In the past few years, neural character animation has emerged and offered an automatic method for animating virtual characters. Their motion is synthesized by a neural network. Controlling this movement in **real time** with a user-defined control signal is also an important task in video games for example. Solutions based on fully-connected layers (MLPs) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have given impressive results in generating and controlling various movements with close-range interactions between the environment and the virtual character. However, a major shortcoming of fully-connected layers is their computational and memory cost which may lead to sub-optimized solution. In this work, we apply pruning algorithms to compress an MLP- MoE neural network in the context of interactive character animation, which reduces its number of parameters and accelerates its computation time with a trade-off between this acceleration and the synthesized motion quality. This work demonstrates that, with the same number of experts and parameters, the pruned model produces less motion artifacts than the dense model and the learned high-level motion features are similar for both

> ABSTRACT  :  This study aims to identify chicken eggs fertility using the support vector machine (SVM) classifier method. The classification basis used the first-order statistical (FOS) parameters as feature extraction in the identification process. This research was developed based on the process's identification process, which is still manual (conventional). Although currently there are many technologies in the identification process, they still need development. Thus, this research is one of the developments in the field of image processing technology. The sample data uses datasets from previous studies with a total of 100 egg images. The egg object in the image is a single object. From these data, the classification of each fertile and infertile egg is 50 image data. Chicken egg image data became input in image processing, with the initial process is segmentation. This initial segmentation aims to get the cropped image according to the object. The cropped image is repaired using image preprocessing with grayscaling and image **enhancement** methods. This method (image **enhancement**) used two combination methods: contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) and histogram equalization (HE). The improved image becomes the input for feature extraction using the FOS method. The FOS uses five parameters, namely mean, entropy, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. The five parameters entered into the SVM classifier method to identify the fertility of chicken eggs. The results of these experiments, the method proposed in the identification process has a success percentage of 84.57%. Thus, the implementation of this method can be used as a reference for future research improvements. In addition, it may be possible to use a second-order feature extraction method to improve its accuracy and improve supervised learning for classification.

> ABSTRACT  :  Land remote sensing analysis is a crucial research in earth science. In this work, we focus on a challenging task of land analysis, i.e., automatic extraction of traffic roads from remote sensing data, which has widespread applications in urban development and expansion estimation. Nevertheless, conventional methods either only utilized the limited information of aerial images, or simply fused multimodal information (e.g., vehicle trajectories), thus cannot well recognize unconstrained roads. To facilitate this problem, we introduce a novel neural network framework termed Cross-Modal Message Propagation Network (CMMPNet), which fully benefits the complementary different modal data (i.e., aerial images and crowdsourced trajectories). Specifically, CMMPNet is composed of two deep Auto-Encoders for modality-specific representation learning and a tailor-designed Dual **Enhancement** Module for cross-modal representation refinement. In particular, the complementary information of each modality is comprehensively extracted and dynamically propagated to enhance the representation of another modality. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our CMMPNet for robust road extraction benefiting from blending different modal data, either using image and trajectory data or image and Lidar data. From the experimental results, we observe that the proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by large margins.Our source code is resealed on the project page \url{<a href="http://lingboliu.com/multimodal">this http URL</a> road extraction.html}

### rVAD: An Unsupervised Segment-Based Robust Voice Activity Detection Method. (arXiv:1906.03588v2 [cs.SD] UPDATED)
- Authors : Hua Tan, Achintya kr, Najim Dehak

> ABSTRACT  :  This paper presents an unsupervised segment-based method for robust voice activity detection (rVAD). The method consists of two passes of denoising followed by a voice activity detection (VAD) stage. In the first pass, high-energy segments in a speech signal are detected by using a posteriori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) weighted energy difference and if no pitch is detected within a segment, the segment is considered as a high-energy noise segment and set to zero. In the second pass, the speech signal is denoised by a speech **enhancement** method, for which several methods are explored. Next, neighbouring frames with pitch are grouped together to form pitch segments, and based on speech statistics, the pitch segments are further extended from both ends in order to include both voiced and unvoiced sounds and likely non-speech parts as well. In the end, a posteriori SNR weighted energy difference is applied to the extended pitch segments of the denoised speech signal for detecting voice activity. We evaluate the VAD performance of the proposed method using two databases, RATS and Aurora-2, which contain a large variety of noise conditions. The rVAD method is further evaluated, in terms of speaker verification performance, on the RedDots 2016 challenge database and its noise-corrupted versions. Experiment results show that rVAD is compared favourably with a number of existing methods. In addition, we present a modified version of rVAD where computationally intensive pitch extraction is replaced by computationally efficient spectral flatness calculation. The modified version significantly reduces the computational complexity at the cost of moderately inferior VAD performance, which is an advantage when processing a large amount of data and running on low resource devices. The source code of rVAD is made publicly available.  
### Pediatric Automatic Sleep Staging: Deep Learning Ensemble Improves Accuracy and Reduces Predictive Uncertainty. (arXiv:2108.10211v2 [eess.SP] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Despite the tremendous progress recently made towards automatic sleep staging in adults, it is currently unknown if the most advanced algorithms generalize to the pediatric population, which displays distinctive characteristics in over**night** polysomnography (PSG). To answer the question, in this work, we conduct a large-scale comparative study on the state-of-the-art deep learning methods for pediatric automatic sleep staging. A selection of six different deep neural networks with diverging features are adopted to evaluate a sample of more than 1,200 children across a wide spectrum of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity. Our experimental results show that the individual performance of automated pediatric sleep stagers when evaluated on new subjects is equivalent to the expert-level one reported on adults. Combining the six stagers into ensemble models further boosts the staging accuracy, reaching an overall accuracy of 87.7%, a Cohen's kappa of 0.837, and a macro F1-score of 84.2% in case of single-channel EEG when evaluated on new subjects. The performance is further improved when dual-channel EEG$\cdot$EOG are used, reaching an accuracy of 88.8%, a Cohen's kappa of 0.852, and a macro F1-score of 85.8%. At the same time, the ensemble models lead to reduced predictive uncertainty. The results also show that the studied algorithms and their ensembles are robust to concept drift when the training and test data were recorded 7-months apart and after clinical intervention. Detailed analyses further demonstrate "almost perfect" agreement between the automatic stagers to one another and their similar patterns on the staging errors.

### pymdp: A Python library for active inference in discrete state spaces. (arXiv:2201.03904v1 [cs.AI])

> ABSTRACT  :  Active inference is an account of cognition and behavior in complex systems which brings together action, perception, and learning under the theoretical mantle of Bayesian inference. Active inference has seen growing applications in academic research, especially in fields that seek to model human or animal behavior. While in recent years, some of the code arising from the active inference literature has been written in open source languages like Python and Julia, to-date, the most popular software for simulating active inference agents is the DEM toolbox of SPM, a MATLAB library originally developed for the statistical analysis and modelling of neuroimaging data. Increasing interest in active inference, manifested both in terms of sheer number as well as diversifying applications across scientific disciplines, has thus created a need for generic, widely-available, and user-friendly code for simulating active inference in open-source scientific computing languages like Python. The Python package we present here, pymdp (see https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp), represents a significant step in this direction: namely, we provide the first open-source package for simulating active inference with partially-observable Markov Decision Processes or POMDPs. We review the package's structure and explain its advantages like modular design and customizability, while providing in-text code blocks along the way to demonstrate how it can be used to build and run active inference processes with ease. We developed pymdp to increase the accessibility and **exposure** of the active inference framework to researchers, engineers, and developers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. In the spirit of open-source software, we also hope that it spurs new innovation, development, and collaboration in the growing active inference community.

### Sequential Randomized Smoothing for Adversarially Robust Speech Recognition. (arXiv:2112.03000v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)
- Authors : Raphael Olivier, Bhiksha Raj

> ABSTRACT  :  While Automatic Speech Recognition has been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, defenses against these attacks are still lagging. Existing, naive defenses can be partially broken with an adaptive attack. In classification tasks, the Randomized Smoothing paradigm has been shown to be effective at defending models. However, it is difficult to apply this paradigm to ASR tasks, due to their complexity and the sequential nature of their outputs. Our paper overcomes some of these challenges by leveraging speech-specific tools like **enhancement** and ROVER voting to design an ASR model that is robust to perturbations. We apply adaptive versions of state-of-the-art attacks, such as the Imperceptible ASR attack, to our model, and show that our strongest defense is robust to all attacks that use inaudible noise, and can only be broken with very high distortion.
