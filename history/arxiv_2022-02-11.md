> ABSTRACT  :  A novel Encoder-Decoder Network with Guided Transmission Map (EDN-GTM) for single image dehazing scheme is proposed in this paper. The proposed EDN-GTM takes conventional RGB hazy image in conjunction with its transmission map estimated by adopting **dark** channel prior as the inputs of the network. The proposed EDN-GTM utilizes U-Net for image segmentation as the core network and utilizes various modifications including spatial pyramid pooling module and Swish activation to achieve state-of-the-art dehazing performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed EDN-GTM outperforms most of traditional and deep learning-based image dehazing schemes in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics. The proposed EDN-GTM furthermore proves its applicability to object detection problems. Specifically, when applied to an image preprocessing tool for driving object detection, the proposed EDN-GTM can efficiently remove haze and significantly improve detection accuracy by 4.73% in terms of mAP measure. The code is available at: https://github.com/tranleanh/edn-gtm.  
### Block-NeRF: Scalable Large Scene Neural View Synthesis. (arXiv:2202.05263v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  We present Block-NeRF, a variant of Neural Radiance Fields that can represent large-scale environments. Specifically, we demonstrate that when scaling NeRF to render city-scale scenes spanning multiple blocks, it is vital to decompose the scene into individually trained NeRFs. This decomposition decouples rendering time from scene size, enables rendering to scale to arbitrarily large environments, and allows per-block updates of the environment. We adopt several architectural changes to make NeRF robust to data captured over months under different environmental conditions. We add appearance embeddings, learned pose refinement, and controllable **exposure** to each individual NeRF, and introduce a procedure for aligning appearance between adjacent NeRFs so that they can be seamlessly combined. We build a grid of Block-NeRFs from 2.8 million images to create the largest neural scene representation to date, capable of rendering an entire neighborhood of San Francisco.  
### Improving Single-Image Defocus Deblurring: How Dual-Pixel Images Help Through Multi-Task Learning. (arXiv:2108.05251v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Many camera sensors use a dual-pixel (DP) design that operates as a rudimentary light field providing two sub-aperture views of a scene in a single capture. The DP sensor was developed to improve how cameras perform autofocus. Since the DP sensor's introduction, researchers have found additional uses for the DP data, such as depth estimation, reflection removal, and defocus deblurring. We are interested in the latter task of defocus deblurring. In particular, we propose a single-image deblurring network that incorporates the two sub-aperture views into a multi-task framework. Specifically, we show that jointly learning to predict the two DP views from a single blurry input image improves the network's ability to learn to deblur the image. Our experiments show this multi-task strategy achieves +1dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art defocus deblurring methods. In addition, our multi-task framework allows accurate DP-view synthesis (e.g., ~39dB PSNR) from the single input image. These high-quality DP views can be used for other DP-based applications, such as reflection removal. As part of this effort, we have captured a new dataset of 7,059 high-quality images to support our training for the DP-view synthesis task. Our dataset, code, and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/Abdullah-Abuolaim/multi-task-defocus-deblurring-dual-pixel-nimat.

### Boosting Graph Neural Networks by Injecting Pooling in Message Passing. (arXiv:2202.04768v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Hyeokjin Kwon, Min Lee
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04768](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04768)
> ABSTRACT  :  There has been tremendous success in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs) as a result of the development of the message-passing (MP) layer, which updates the representation of a node by combining it with its neighbors to address variable-size and unordered graphs. Despite the fruitful progress of MP GNNs, their performance can suffer from over-smoothing, when node representations become too similar and even indistinguishable from one another. Furthermore, it has been reported that intrinsic graph structures are smoothed out as the GNN layer increases. Inspired by the edge-preserving **bilateral** filters used in image processing, we propose a new, adaptable, and powerful MP framework to prevent over-smoothing. Our **bilateral**-MP estimates a pairwise modular gradient by utilizing the class information of nodes, and further preserves the global graph structure by using the gradient when the aggregating function is applied. Our proposed scheme can be generalized to all ordinary MP GNNs. Experiments on five medium-size benchmark datasets using four state-of-the-art MP GNNs indicate that the **bilateral**-MP improves performance by alleviating over-smoothing. By inspecting quantitative measurements, we additionally validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism in preventing the over-smoothing issue.  
### Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Speech **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2202.05256v1 [eess.AS])
- Authors : Ju Lu, Qiu Wang, Shinji Watanabe, Alexander Richard, Cheng Yu, Yu Tsao

> ABSTRACT  :  Speech **enhancement** is a critical component of many user-oriented audio applications, yet current systems still suffer from distorted and unnatural outputs. While generative models have shown strong potential in speech synthesis, they are still lagging behind in speech **enhancement**. This work leverages recent advances in diffusion probabilistic models, and proposes a novel speech **enhancement** algorithm that incorporates characteristics of the observed noisy speech signal into the diffusion and reverse processes. More specifically, we propose a generalized formulation of the diffusion probabilistic model named conditional diffusion probabilistic model that, in its reverse process, can adapt to non-Gaussian real noises in the estimated speech signal. In our experiments, we demonstrate strong performance of the proposed approach compared to representative generative models, and investigate the generalization capability of our models to other datasets with noise characteristics unseen during training.  
### BLOOM-Net: Blockwise Optimization for Masking Networks Toward Scalable and Efficient Speech **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2111.09372v2 [eess.AS] UPDATED)
- Authors : Sunwoo Kim, Minje Kim
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09372](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09372)
> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we present a blockwise optimization method for masking-based networks (BLOOM-Net) for training scalable speech **enhancement** networks. Here, we design our network with a residual learning scheme and train the internal separator blocks sequentially to obtain a scalable masking-based deep neural network for speech **enhancement**. Its scalability lets it dynamically adjust the run-time complexity depending on the test time environment. To this end, we modularize our models in that they can flexibly accommodate varying needs for **enhancement** performance and constraints on the resources, incurring minimal memory or training overhead due to the added scalability. Our experiments on speech **enhancement** demonstrate that the proposed blockwise optimization method achieves the desired scalability with only a slight performance degradation compared to corresponding models trained end-to-end.  
### The **Dark** Side of the Language: Pre-trained Transformers in the **Dark**Net. (arXiv:2201.05613v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Pre-trained Transformers are challenging human performances in many natural language processing tasks. The gigantic datasets used for pre-training seem to be the key for their success on existing tasks. In this paper, we explore how a range of pre-trained natural language understanding models perform on truly novel and unexplored data, provided by classification tasks over a **Dark**Net corpus. Surprisingly, results show that syntactic and lexical neural networks largely outperform pre-trained Transformers. This seems to suggest that pre-trained Transformers have serious difficulties in adapting to radically novel texts.

### Royalflush Speaker Diarization System for ICASSP 2022 Multi-channel Multi-party Meeting Transcription Challenge. (arXiv:2202.04814v1 [cs.SD])
- Authors : Jingguang Tian, Xinhui Hu, Xinkang Xu
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04814](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04814)
> ABSTRACT  :  This paper describes the Royalflush speaker diarization system submitted to the Multi-channel Multi-party Meeting Transcription Challenge. Our system comprises speech **enhancement**, overlapped speech detection, speaker embedding extraction, speaker clustering, speech separation and system fusion. In this system, we made three contributions. First, we propose an architecture of combining the multi-channel and U-Net-based models, aiming at utilizing the benefits of these two individual architectures, for far-field overlapped speech detection. Second, in order to use overlapped speech detection model to help speaker diarization, a speech separation based overlapped speech handling approach, in which the speaker verification technique is further applied, is proposed. Third, we explore three speaker embedding methods, and obtained the state-of-the-art performance on the CNCeleb-E test set. With these proposals, our best individual system significantly reduces DER from 15.25% to 6.40%, and the fusion of four systems finally achieves a DER of 6.30% on the far-field Alimeeting evaluation set.
