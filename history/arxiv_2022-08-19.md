### **Restoration** of User Videos Shared on Social Media. (arXiv:2208.08597v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  User videos shared on social media platforms usually suffer from degradations caused by unknown proprietary processing procedures, which means that their visual quality is poorer than that of the originals. This paper presents a new general video **restoration** framework for the **restoration** of user videos shared on social media platforms. In contrast to most deep learning-based video **restoration** methods that perform end-to-end mapping, where feature extraction is mostly treated as a black box, in the sense that what role a feature plays is often unknown, our new method, termed Video restOration through adapTive dEgradation Sensing (VOTES), introduces the concept of a degradation feature map (DFM) to explicitly guide the video **restoration** process. Specifically, for each video frame, we first adaptively estimate its DFM to extract features representing the difficulty of restoring its different regions. We then feed the DFM to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to compute hierarchical degradation features to modulate an end-to-end video **restoration** backbone network, such that more attention is paid explicitly to potentially more difficult to restore areas, which in turn leads to enhanced **restoration** performance. We will explain the design rationale of the VOTES framework and present extensive experimental results to show that the new VOTES method outperforms various state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition, we contribute a large scale real-world database of user videos shared on different social media platforms. Codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/luohongming/VOTES.git

> ABSTRACT  :  We present a novel paradigm of building an animatable 3D human representation from a monocular video input, such that it can be rendered in any unseen poses and views. Our method is based on a dynamic Neural Radiance Field (**NeRF**) rigged by a mesh-based parametric 3D human model serving as a geometry proxy. Previous methods usually rely on multi-view videos or accurate 3D geometry information as additional inputs; besides, most methods suffer from degraded quality when generalized to unseen poses. We identify that the key to generalization is a good input embedding for querying dynamic **NeRF**: A good input embedding should define an injective mapping in the full volumetric space, guided by surface mesh deformation under pose variation. Based on this observation, we propose to embed the input query with its relationship to local surface regions spanned by a set of geodesic nearest neighbors on mesh vertices. By including both position and relative distance information, our embedding defines a distance-preserved deformation mapping and generalizes well to unseen poses. To reduce the dependency on additional inputs, we first initialize per-frame 3D meshes using off-the-shelf tools and then propose a pipeline to jointly optimize **NeRF** and refine the initial mesh. Extensive experiments show our method can synthesize plausible human rendering results under unseen poses and views.

> ABSTRACT  :  Recent trackers adopt the Transformer to combine or replace the widely used ResNet as their new backbone network. Although their trackers work well in regular scenarios, however, they simply flatten the 2D features into a sequence to better match the Transformer. We believe these operations ignore the spatial prior of the target object which may lead to sub-optimal results only. In addition, many works demonstrate that self-attention is actually a low-pass filter, which is independent of input features or key/queries. That is to say, it may suppress the high-frequency component of the input features and preserve or even amplify the low-frequency information. To handle these issues, in this paper, we propose a unified Spatial-Frequency Transformer that models the Gaussian spatial Prior and High-frequency emphasis Attention (GPHA) simultaneously. To be specific, Gaussian spatial prior is generated using dual Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and injected into the similarity matrix produced by multiplying Query and Key features in self-attention. The output will be fed into a Softmax layer and then decomposed into two components, i.e., the direct signal and high-frequency signal. The low- and high-pass branches are rescaled and combined to achieve all-pass, therefore, the high-frequency features will be protected well in stacked self-attention layers. We further integrate the Spatial-Frequency Transformer into the Siamese tracking framework and propose a novel tracking algorithm, termed SFTransT. The cross-scale fusion based **Swin**Transformer is adopted as the backbone, and also a multi-head cross-attention module is used to boost the interaction between search and template features. The output will be fed into the tracking head for target localization. Extensive experiments on both short-term and long-term tracking benchmarks all demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

> ABSTRACT  :  At the end of an extensive investigation of the volcanic eruptions in the world, we determined patterns that coincide in this process, this data can be analyzed by artificial vision, obtaining the largest amount of information from images in an embedded system, using monitoring algorithms for compare continuous matrices, control camera positioning and link this information with mass communication technologies.

> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we propose a Text-Degradation Invariant Auto Encoder (Text-DIAE), a self-supervised model designed to tackle two tasks, text recognition (handwritten or scene-text) and document image **enhancement**. We start by employing a transformer-based architecture that incorporates three pretext tasks as learning objectives to be optimized during pre-training without the usage of labeled data. Each of the pretext objectives is specifically tailored for the final downstream tasks. We conduct several ablation experiments that confirm the design choice of the selected pretext tasks. Importantly, the proposed model does not exhibit limitations of previous state-of-the-art methods based on contrastive losses, while at the same time requiring substantially fewer data samples to converge. Finally, we demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art in existing supervised and self-supervised settings in handwritten and scene text recognition and document image **enhancement**. Our code and trained models will be made publicly available at~\url{ <a href="http://Upon_Acceptance">this http URL</a>}.  
### Learnability **Enhancement** for **Low-light** Raw Denoising: Where Paired Real Data Meets Noise Modeling. (arXiv:2207.06103v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Hansen Feng, Lizhi Wang, Yuzhi Wang, Hua Huang
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06103](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06103)
> ABSTRACT  :  **Low-light** raw denoising is an important and valuable task in computational photography where learning-based methods trained with paired real data are mainstream. However, the limited data volume and complicated noise distribution have constituted a learnability bottleneck for paired real data, which limits the denoising performance of learning-based methods. To address this issue, we present a learnability **enhancement** strategy to reform paired real data according to noise modeling. Our strategy consists of two efficient techniques: shot noise augmentation (SNA) and **dark** shading correction (DSC). Through noise model decoupling, SNA improves the precision of data mapping by increasing the data volume and DSC reduces the complexity of data mapping by reducing the noise complexity. Extensive results on the public datasets and real imaging scenarios collectively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

### A Topological Loss Function for **Low-Light** Image Denoising. (arXiv:2208.04573v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04573](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04573)
> ABSTRACT  :  Although image denoising algorithms have attracted significant research attention, surprisingly few have been proposed for, or evaluated on, noise from imagery acquired under real **low-light** conditions. Moreover, noise characteristics are often assumed to be spatially invariant, leading to edges and textures being distorted after denoising. Here, we introduce a novel topological loss function which is based on persistent homology, offering true features with resistance to noise across multiple scales. The method performs in the space of image patches, where topological invariants are calculated and represented in persistent diagrams. The loss function is a combination of $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ losses with the new persistence-based topological loss. We compare its performance across popular denoising architectures, training the networks on our new comprehensive dataset of natural images captured in **low-light** conditions -- BVI-LOWLIGHT. Analysis reveals that this approach outperforms existing methods, adapting well to edges and complex structures and suppressing common artifacts.

### "Task-relevant autoencoding" enhances machine learning for human neuroscience. (arXiv:2208.08478v1 [q-bio.NC])

> ABSTRACT  :  In human neuroscience, machine learning can help reveal lower-dimensional neural representations relevant to subjects' behavior. However, state-of-the-art models typically require large datasets to train, so are prone to overfitting on human neuroimaging data that often possess few samples but many input dimensions. Here, we capitalized on the fact that the features we seek in human neuroscience are precisely those relevant to subjects' behavior. We thus developed a Task-Relevant Autoencoder via Classifier **Enhancement** (TRACE), and tested its ability to extract behaviorally-relevant, separable representations compared to a standard autoencoder for two severely truncated machine learning datasets. We then evaluated both models on fMRI data where subjects observed animals and objects. TRACE outperformed both the autoencoder and raw inputs nearly unilaterally, showing up to 30% increased classification accuracy and up to threefold improvement in discovering "cleaner", task-relevant representations. These results showcase TRACE's potential for a wide variety of data related to human behavior.  
### Analysis of Digitalized ECG Signals Based on Artificial Intelligence and Spectral Analysis Methods Specialized in ARVC. (arXiv:2203.00504v3 [eess.SP] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that appears between the second and forth decade of a patient's life, being responsible for 20% of sudden cardiac deaths before the age of 35. The effective and punctual diagnosis of this disease based on Electrocardiograms (ECGs) could have a vital role in reducing premature cardiovascular mortality. In our analysis, we firstly outline the digitalization process of paper - based ECG signals enhanced by a spatial filter aiming to eliminate **dark** regions in the dataset's images that do not correspond to ECG waveform, producing undesirable noise. Next, we propose the utilization of a low - complexity convolutional neural network for the detection of an arrhythmogenic heart disease, that has not been studied through the usage of deep learning methodology to date, achieving high classification accuracy, namely 99.98% training and 98.6% testing accuracy, on a disease the major identification criterion of which are infinitesimal millivolt variations in the ECG's morphology, in contrast with other arrhythmogenic abnormalities. Finally, by performing spectral analysis we investigate significant differentiations in the field of frequencies between normal ECGs and ECGs corresponding to patients suffering from ARVC. In 16 out of the 18 frequencies where we encounter statistically significant differentiations, the normal ECGs are characterized by greater normalized amplitudes compared to the abnormal ones. The overall research carried out in this article highlights the importance of integrating mathematical methods into the examination and effective diagnosis of various diseases, aiming to a substantial contribution to their successful treatment.

> ABSTRACT  :  With breakthrough of the AlphaGo, human-computer gaming AI has ushered in a big explosion, attracting more and more researchers all around the world. As a recognized standard for testing artificial intelligence, various human-computer gaming AI systems (AIs) have been developed such as the Libratus, OpenAI Five and AlphaStar, beating professional human players. The rapid development of human-computer gaming AIs indicate a big step of decision making intelligence, and it seems that current techniques can handle very complex human-computer games. So, one natural question raises: what are the possible challenges of current techniques in human-computer gaming, and what are the future trends? To answer the above question, in this paper, we survey recent successful game AIs, covering board game AIs, card game AIs, first-person shooting game AIs and **real time** strategy game AIs. Through this survey, we 1) compare the main difficulties among different kinds of games and the corresponding techniques utilized for achieving professional human level AIs; 2) summarize the mainstream frameworks and techniques that can be properly relied on for developing AIs for complex human-computer gaming; 3) raise the challenges or drawbacks of current techniques in the successful AIs; and 4) try to point out future trends in human-computer gaming AIs. Finally, we hope this brief review can provide an introduction for beginners, and inspire insights for researchers in the field of AI in human-computer gaming.  
### Shielding Federated Learning Systems against Inference Attacks with ARM TrustZone. (arXiv:2208.05895v2 [cs.CR] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Federated Learning (FL) opens new perspectives for training machine learning models while keeping personal data on the users premises. Specifically, in FL, models are trained on the users devices and only model updates (i.e., gradients) are sent to a central server for aggregation purposes. However, the long list of inference attacks that leak private data from gradients, published in the recent years, have emphasized the need of devising effective protection mechanisms to incentivize the adoption of FL at scale. While there exist solutions to mitigate these attacks on the server side, little has been done to protect users from attacks performed on the client side. In this context, the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) on the client side are among the most proposing solutions. However, existing frameworks (e.g., **Dark**neTZ) require statically putting a large portion of the machine learning model into the TEE to effectively protect against complex attacks or a combination of attacks. We present GradSec, a solution that allows protecting in a TEE only sensitive layers of a machine learning model, either statically or dynamically, hence reducing both the TCB size and the overall training time by up to 30% and 56%, respectively compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
