### Unsupervised **Restoration** of Weather-affected Images using Deep Gaussian Process-based CycleGAN. (arXiv:2204.10970v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Existing approaches for restoring weather-degraded images follow a fully-supervised paradigm and they require paired data for training. However, collecting paired data for weather degradations is extremely challenging, and existing methods end up training on synthetic data. To overcome this issue, we describe an approach for supervising deep networks that are based on CycleGAN, thereby enabling the use of unlabeled real-world data for training. Specifically, we introduce new losses for training CycleGAN that lead to more effective training, resulting in high-quality reconstructions. These new losses are obtained by jointly modeling the latent space embeddings of predicted clean images and original clean images through Deep Gaussian Processes. This enables the CycleGAN architecture to transfer the knowledge from one domain (weather-degraded) to another (clean) more effectively. We demonstrate that the proposed method can be effectively applied to different **restoration** tasks like de-raining, de-hazing and de-snowing and it outperforms other unsupervised techniques (that leverage weather-based characteristics) by a considerable margin.

> ABSTRACT  :  Depth Estimation and Object Detection Recognition play an important role in autonomous driving technology under the guidance of deep learning artificial intelligence. We propose a hybrid structure called RealNet: a co-design method combining the model-streamlined recognition algorithm, the depth estimation algorithm with information fusion, and deploying them on the Jetson-Nano for unmanned vehicles with monocular vision sensors. We use ROS for experiment. The method proposed in this paper is suitable for mobile platforms with high real-time request. Innovation of our method is using information fusion to compensate the problem of insufficient frame rate of output image, and improve the robustness of target detection and depth estimation under monocular vision.Object Detection is based on YOLO-v5. We have simplified the network structure of its **Dark**Net53 and realized a prediction speed up to 0.01s. Depth Estimation is based on the VNL Depth Estimation, which considers multiple geometric constraints in 3D global space. It calculates the loss function by calculating the deviation of the virtual normal vector VN and the label, which can obtain deeper depth information. We use PnP fusion algorithm to solve the problem of insufficient frame rate of depth map output. It solves the motion estimation depth from three-dimensional target to two-dimensional point based on corner feature matching, which is faster than VNL calculation. We interpolate VNL output and PnP output to achieve information fusion. Experiments show that this can effectively eliminate the jitter of depth information and improve robustness. At the control end, this method combines the results of target detection and depth estimation to calculate the target position, and uses a pure tracking control algorithm to track it.  
### DRT: A Lightweight Single Image Deraining Recursive Transformer. (arXiv:2204.11385v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Over parameterization is a common technique in deep learning to help models learn and generalize sufficiently to the given task; nonetheless, this often leads to enormous network structures and consumes considerable computing resources during training. Recent powerful transformer-based deep learning models on vision tasks usually have heavy parameters and bear training difficulty. However, many dense-prediction low-level computer vision tasks, such as rain streak removing, often need to be executed on devices with limited computing power and memory in practice. Hence, we introduce a recursive local window-based self-attention structure with residual connections and propose deraining a recursive transformer (DRT), which enjoys the superiority of the transformer but requires a small amount of computing resources. In particular, through recursive architecture, our proposed model uses only 1.3% of the number of parameters of the current best performing model in deraining while exceeding the state-of-the-art methods on the Rain100L benchmark by at least 0.33 dB. Ablation studies also investigate the impact of recursions on derain outcomes. Moreover, since the model contains no deliberate design for deraining, it can also be applied to other image **restoration** tasks. Our experiment shows that it can achieve competitive results on desnowing. The source code and pretrained model can be found at https://github.com/YC-Liang/DRT.

> ABSTRACT  :  Given the increasing number of livestreaming videos, automatic speech recognition and post-processing for livestreaming video transcripts are crucial for efficient data management as well as knowledge mining. A key step in this process is punctuation **restoration** which restores fundamental text structures such as phrase and sentence boundaries from the video transcripts. This work presents a new human-annotated corpus, called BehancePR, for punctuation **restoration** in livestreaming video transcripts. Our experiments on BehancePR demonstrate the challenges of punctuation **restoration** for this domain. Furthermore, we show that popular natural language processing toolkits are incapable of detecting sentence boundary on non-punctuated transcripts of livestreaming videos, calling for more research effort to develop robust models for this area.

> ABSTRACT  :  Underwater Image Rendering aims to generate a true-tolife underwater image from a given clean one, which could be applied to various practical applications such as underwater image **enhancement**, camera filter, and virtual gaming. We explore two less-touched but challenging problems in underwater image rendering, namely, i) how to render diverse underwater scenes by a single neural network? ii) how to adaptively learn the underwater light fields from natural exemplars, i,e., realistic underwater images? To this end, we propose a neural rendering method for underwater imaging, dubbed UWNR (Underwater Neural Rendering). Specifically, UWNR is a data-driven neural network that implicitly learns the natural degenerated model from authentic underwater images, avoiding introducing erroneous biases by hand-craft imaging models. Compared with existing underwater image generation methods, UWNR utilizes the natural light field to simulate the main characteristics ofthe underwater scene. Thus, it is able to synthesize a wide variety ofunderwater images from one clean image with various realistic underwater images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves better visual effects and quantitative metrics over previous methods. Moreover, we adopt UWNR to build an open Large Neural Rendering Underwater Dataset containing various types of water quality, dubbed LNRUD. The source code and LNRUD are available at https: //github.com/Ephemeral182/UWNR.

> ABSTRACT  :  Precise representations of 3D faces are beneficial to various computer vision and graphics applications. Due to the data discretization and model linearity, however, it remains challenging to capture accurate identity and expression clues in current studies. This paper presents a novel 3D morphable face model, namely ImFace, to learn a nonlinear and continuous space with **implicit neural representation**s. It builds two explicitly disentangled deformation fields to model complex shapes associated with identities and expressions, respectively, and designs an improved learning strategy to extend embeddings of expressions to allow more diverse changes. We further introduce a Neural Blend-Field to learn sophisticated details by adaptively blending a series of local fields. In addition to ImFace, an effective preprocessing pipeline is proposed to address the issue of watertight input requirement in implicit representations, enabling them to work with common facial surfaces for the first time. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the superiority of ImFace.

> ABSTRACT  :  Text-Video Retrieval plays an important role in multi-modal understanding and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Most existing methods focus on constructing contrastive pairs between whole videos and complete caption sentences, while ignoring fine-grained cross-modal relationships, e.g., short clips and phrases or single frame and word. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named HunYuan\_tvr, to explore hierarchical cross-modal interactions by simultaneously exploring video-sentence, clip-phrase, and frame-word relationships. Considering intrinsic semantic relations between frames, HunYuan\_tvr first performs self-attention to explore frame-wise correlations and adaptively clusters correlated frames into clip-level representations. Then, the clip-wise correlation is explored to aggregate clip representations into a compact one to describe the video globally. In this way, we can construct hierarchical video representations for frame-clip-video granularities, and also explore word-wise correlations to form word-phrase-sentence embeddings for the text modality. Finally, hierarchical contrastive learning is designed to explore cross-modal relationships,~\emph{i.e.,} frame-word, clip-phrase, and video-sentence, which enables HunYuan\_tvr to achieve a comprehensive multi-modal understanding. Further boosted by adaptive label denoising and marginal sample **enhancement**, HunYuan\_tvr obtains new state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, e.g., Rank@1 of 55.0%, 57.8%, 29.7%, 52.1%, and 57.3% on MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, DiDemo, and ActivityNet respectively.

> ABSTRACT  :  Light guide plates are essential optical components widely used in a diverse range of applications ranging from medical lighting fixtures to back-lit TV displays. An essential step in the manufacturing of light guide plates is the quality inspection of defects such as scratches, bright/**dark** spots, and impurities. This is mainly done in industry through manual visual inspection for plate pattern irregularities, which is time-consuming and prone to human error and thus act as a significant barrier to high-throughput production. Advances in deep learning-driven computer vision has led to the exploration of automated visual quality inspection of light guide plates to improve inspection consistency, accuracy, and efficiency. However, given the cost constraints in visual inspection scenarios, the widespread adoption of deep learning-driven computer vision methods for inspecting light guide plates has been greatly limited due to high computational requirements. In this study, we explore the utilization of machine-driven design exploration with computational and "best-practices" constraints as well as L$_1$ paired classification discrepancy loss to create LightDefectNet, a highly compact deep anti-aliased attention condenser neural network architecture tailored specifically for light guide plate surface defect detection in resource-constrained scenarios. Experiments show that LightDetectNet achieves a detection accuracy of $\sim$98.2% on the LGPSDD benchmark while having just 770K parameters ($\sim$33$\times$ and $\sim$6.9$\times$ lower than ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B0, respectively) and $\sim$93M FLOPs ($\sim$88$\times$ and $\sim$8.4$\times$ lower than ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B0, respectively) and $\sim$8.8$\times$ faster inference speed than EfficientNet-B0 on an embedded ARM processor.

### Improved far-field speech recognition using Joint Variational Autoencoder. (arXiv:2204.11286v1 [eess.AS])
- Authors : Shashi Kumar, Abhishek Pandey
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11286](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11286)
> ABSTRACT  :  Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems suffer considerably when source speech is corrupted with noise or room impulse responses (RIR). Typically, speech **enhancement** is applied in both mismatched and matched scenario training and testing. In matched setting, acoustic model (AM) is trained on dereverberated far-field features while in mismatched setting, AM is fixed. In recent past, mapping speech features from far-field to close-talk using denoising autoencoder (DA) has been explored. In this paper, we focus on matched scenario training and show that the proposed joint VAE based mapping achieves a significant improvement over DA. Specifically, we observe an absolute improvement of 2.5% in word error rate (WER) compared to DA based **enhancement** and 3.96% compared to AM trained directly on far-field filterbank features.  
### **Real-time** Speech Emotion Recognition Based on Syllable-Level Feature Extraction. (arXiv:2204.11382v1 [cs.SD])

> ABSTRACT  :  Speech emotion recognition systems have high prediction latency because of the high computational requirements for deep learning models and low generalizability mainly because of the poor reliability of emotional measurements across multiple corpora. To solve these problems, we present a speech emotion recognition system based on a reductionist approach of decomposing and analyzing syllable-level features. Mel-spectrogram of an audio stream is decomposed into syllable-level components, which are then analyzed to extract statistical features. The proposed method uses formant attention, noise-gate filtering, and rolling normalization contexts to increase feature processing speed and tolerance to adversity. A set of syllable-level formant features is extracted and fed into a single hidden layer neural network that makes predictions for each syllable as opposed to the conventional approach of using a sophisticated deep learner to make sentence-wide predictions. The syllable level predictions help to achieve the real-time latency and lower the aggregated error in utterance level cross-corpus predictions. The experiments on IEMOCAP (IE), MSP-Improv (MI), and RAVDESS (RA) databases show that the method archives real-time latency while predicting with state-of-the-art cross-corpus unweighted accuracy of 47.6% for IE to MI and 56.2% for MI to IE.

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11399](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11399)
> ABSTRACT  :  We present an efficient Neural Neighborhood Search (N2S) approach for pickup and delivery problems (PDPs). In specific, we design a powerful Synthesis Attention that allows the vanilla self-attention to synthesize various types of features regarding a route solution. We also exploit two customized decoders that automatically learn to perform removal and reinsertion of a pickup-delivery node pair to tackle the precedence constraint. Additionally, a diversity **enhancement** scheme is leveraged to further ameliorate the performance. Our N2S is generic, and extensive experiments on two canonical PDP variants show that it can produce state-of-the-art results among existing neural methods. Moreover, it even outstrips the well-known LKH3 solver on the more constrained PDP variant. Our implementation for N2S is available online.  
### CITISEN: A Deep Learning-Based Speech Signal-Processing Mobile Application. (arXiv:2008.09264v5 [eess.AS] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09264](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09264)
> ABSTRACT  :  This study presents a deep learning-based speech signal-processing mobile application known as CITISEN. The CITISEN provides three functions: speech **enhancement** (SE), model adaptation (MA), and background noise conversion (BNC), allowing CITISEN to be used as a platform for utilizing and evaluating SE models and flexibly extend the models to address various noise environments and users. For SE, a pretrained SE model downloaded from the cloud server is used to effectively reduce noise components from instant or saved recordings provided by users. For encountering unseen noise or speaker environments, the MA function is applied to promote CITISEN. A few audio samples recording on a noisy environment are uploaded and used to adapt the pretrained SE model on the server. Finally, for BNC, CITISEN first removes the background noises through an SE model and then mixes the processed speech with new background noise. The novel BNC function can evaluate SE performance under specific conditions, cover people's tracks, and provide entertainment. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of SE, MA, and BNC functions. Compared with the noisy speech signals, the enhanced speech signals achieved about 6\% and 33\% of improvements, respectively, in terms of short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). With MA, the STOI and PESQ could be further improved by approximately 6\% and 11\%, respectively. Finally, the BNC experiment results indicated that the speech signals converted from noisy and silent backgrounds have a close scene identification accuracy and similar embeddings in an acoustic scene classification model. Therefore, the proposed BNC can effectively convert the background noise of a speech signal and be a data augmentation method when clean speech signals are unavailable.

### Optimizing generalized Gini indices for fairness in rankings. (arXiv:2204.06521v3 [cs.IR] UPDATED)
- Authors : Virginie Do, Nicolas Usunier
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06521](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06521)
> ABSTRACT  :  There is growing interest in designing recommender systems that aim at being fair towards item producers or their least satisfied users. Inspired by the domain of inequality measurement in economics, this paper explores the use of generalized Gini welfare functions (GGFs) as a means to specify the normative criterion that recommender systems should optimize for. GGFs weight individuals depending on their ranks in the population, giving more weight to worse-off individuals to promote equality. Depending on these weights, GGFs minimize the Gini index of item **exposure** to promote equality between items, or focus on the performance on specific quantiles of least satisfied users. GGFs for ranking are challenging to optimize because they are non-differentiable. We resolve this challenge by leveraging tools from non-smooth optimization and projection operators used in differentiable sorting. We present experiments using real datasets with up to 15k users and items, which show that our approach obtains better trade-offs than the baselines on a variety of recommendation tasks and fairness criteria.
