### E-CIR: Event-Enhanced Continuous Intensity Recovery. (arXiv:2203.01935v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors : Chen Song, Qixing Huang, Chandrajit Bajaj

> ABSTRACT  :  A camera begins to sense light the moment we press the shutter button. During the **exposure** interval, relative motion between the scene and the camera causes motion blur, a common undesirable visual artifact. This paper presents E-CIR, which converts a blurry image into a sharp video represented as a parametric function from time to intensity. E-CIR leverages events as an auxiliary input. We discuss how to exploit the temporal event structure to construct the parametric bases. We demonstrate how to train a deep learning model to predict the function coefficients. To improve the appearance consistency, we further introduce a refinement module to propagate visual features among consecutive frames. Compared to state-of-the-art event-enhanced deblurring approaches, E-CIR generates smoother and more realistic results. The implementation of E-CIR is available at https://github.com/chensong1995/E-CIR.

> ABSTRACT  :  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used for many applications in recent years, from urban search and rescue, to agricultural surveying, to autonomous underground mine exploration. However, deploying UAVs in tight, indoor spaces, especially close to humans, remains a challenge. One solution, when limited payload is required, is to use micro-UAVs, which pose less risk to humans and typically cost less to replace after a crash. However, micro-UAVs can only carry a limited sensor suite, e.g. a monocular camera instead of a stereo pair or LiDAR, complicating tasks like dense mapping and markerless multi-person 3D human pose estimation, which are needed to operate in tight environments around people. Monocular approaches to such tasks exist, and dense monocular mapping approaches have been successfully deployed for UAV applications. However, despite many recent works on both marker-based and markerless multi-UAV single-person motion capture, markerless single-camera multi-person 3D human pose estimation remains a much earlier-stage technology, and we are not aware of existing attempts to deploy it in an aerial context. In this paper, we present what is thus, to our knowledge, the first system to perform simultaneous mapping and multi-person 3D human pose estimation from a monocular camera mounted on a single UAV. In particular, we show how to loosely couple state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation and monocular 3D human pose estimation approaches to reconstruct a hybrid map of a populated indoor scene in **real time**. We validate our component-level design choices via extensive experiments on the large-scale ScanNet and GTA-IM datasets. To evaluate our system-level performance, we also construct a new Oxford Hybrid Mapping dataset of populated indoor scenes.  
### Multi-modality Deep **Restoration** of Extremely Compressed Face Videos. (arXiv:2107.05548v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Arguably the most common and salient object in daily video communications is the talking head, as encountered in social media, virtual classrooms, teleconferences, news broadcasting, talk shows, etc. When communication bandwidth is limited by network congestions or cost effectiveness, compression artifacts in talking head videos are inevitable. The resulting video quality degradation is highly visible and objectionable due to high acuity of human visual system to faces. To solve this problem, we develop a multi-modality deep convolutional neural network method for restoring face videos that are aggressively compressed. The main innovation is a new DCNN architecture that incorporates known priors of multiple modalities: the video-synchronized speech signal and semantic elements of the compression code stream, including motion vectors, code partition map and quantization parameters. These priors strongly correlate with the latent video and hence they are able to enhance the capability of deep learning to remove compression artifacts. Ample empirical evidences are presented to validate the superior performance of the proposed DCNN method on face videos over the existing state-of-the-art methods.

> ABSTRACT  :  The fovea is an important anatomical landmark of the retina. Detecting the location of the fovea is essential for the analysis of many retinal diseases. However, robust fovea localization remains a challenging problem, as the fovea region often appears fuzzy, and retina diseases may further obscure its appearance. This paper proposes a novel Vision Transformer (ViT) approach that integrates information both inside and outside the fovea region to achieve robust fovea localization. Our proposed network, named **Bilateral**-Vision-Transformer (**Bilateral**-ViT), consists of two network branches: a transformer-based main network branch for integrating global context across the entire fundus image and a vessel branch for explicitly incorporating the structure of blood vessels. The encoded features from both network branches are subsequently merged with a customized Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly more robust for diseased images and establishes the new state of the arts using the Messidor and PALM datasets.  
### Texture-enhanced Light Field Super-resolution with Spatio-Angular Decomposition Kernels. (arXiv:2111.04069v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Despite the recent progress in light field super-resolution (LFSR) achieved by convolutional neural networks, the correlation information of light field (LF) images has not been sufficiently studied and exploited due to the complexity of 4D LF data. To cope with such high-dimensional LF data, most of the existing LFSR methods resorted to decomposing it into lower dimensions and subsequently performing optimization on the decomposed sub-spaces. However, these methods are inherently limited as they neglected the characteristics of the decomposition operations and only utilized a limited set of LF sub-spaces ending up failing to sufficiently extract spatio-angular features and leading to a performance bottleneck. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we comprehensively discover the potentials of LF decomposition and propose a novel concept of decomposition kernels. In particular, we systematically unify the decomposition operations of various sub-spaces into a series of such decomposition kernels, which are incorporated into our proposed Decomposition Kernel Network (DKNet) for comprehensive spatio-angular feature extraction. The proposed DKNet is experimentally verified to achieve considerable improvements compared with the state-of-the-art methods. To further improve DKNet in producing more visually pleasing LFSR results, based on the VGG network, we propose a LFVGG loss to guide the Texture-Enhanced DKNet (TE-DKNet) to generate rich authentic textures and enhance LF images' visual quality significantly. We also propose an indirect evaluation metric by taking advantage of LF material recognition to objectively assess the perceptual **enhancement** brought by the LFVGG loss.  
### Iterative Saliency **Enhancement** using Superpixel Similarity. (arXiv:2112.00665v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Saliency Object Detection (SOD) has several applications in image analysis. The methods have evolved from image-intrinsic to object-inspired (deep-learning-based) models. When a model fail, however, there is no alternative to enhance its saliency map. We fill this gap by introducing a hybrid approach, named \textit{Iterative Saliency **Enhancement** over Superpixel Similarity} (ISESS), that iteratively generates enhanced saliency maps by executing two operations alternately: object-based superpixel segmentation and superpixel-based saliency estimation -- cycling operations never exploited. ISESS estimates seeds for superpixel delineation from a given saliency map and defines superpixel queries in the foreground and background. A new saliency map results from color similarities between queries and superpixels at each iteration. The process repeats and, after a given number of iterations, the generated saliency maps are combined into one by cellular automata. Finally, the resulting map is merged with the initial one by the maximum bewteen their average values per superpixel. We demonstrate that our hybrid model can consistently outperform three state-of-the-art deep-learning-based methods on five image datasets.  
### Event-based Video Reconstruction via Potential-assisted Spiking Neural Network. (arXiv:2201.10943v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Neuromorphic vision sensor is a new bio-inspired imaging paradigm that reports asynchronous, continuously per-pixel brightness changes called `events' with high temporal resolution and **high dynamic range**. So far, the event-based image reconstruction methods are based on artificial neural networks (ANN) or hand-crafted spatiotemporal smoothing techniques. In this paper, we first implement the image reconstruction work via fully spiking neural network (SNN) architecture. As the bio-inspired neural networks, SNNs operating with asynchronous binary spikes distributed over time, can potentially lead to greater computational efficiency on event-driven hardware. We propose a novel Event-based Video reconstruction framework based on a fully Spiking Neural Network (EVSNN), which utilizes Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron and Membrane Potential (MP) neuron. We find that the spiking neurons have the potential to store useful temporal information (memory) to complete such time-dependent tasks. Furthermore, to better utilize the temporal information, we propose a hybrid potential-assisted framework (PA-EVSNN) using the membrane potential of spiking neuron. The proposed neuron is referred as Adaptive Membrane Potential (AMP) neuron, which adaptively updates the membrane potential according to the input spikes. The experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve comparable performance to ANN-based models on IJRR, MVSEC, and HQF datasets. The energy consumptions of EVSNN and PA-EVSNN are 19.36$\times$ and 7.75$\times$ more computationally efficient than their ANN architectures, respectively.

### Integrating Statistical Uncertainty into Neural Network-Based Speech **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2203.02288v1 [eess.AS])
- Authors : Huajian Fang, Tal Peer, Stefan Wermter, Timo Gerkmann
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02288](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02288)
> ABSTRACT  :  Speech **enhancement** in the time-frequency domain is often performed by estimating a multiplicative mask to extract clean speech. However, most neural network-based methods perform point estimation, i.e., their output consists of a single mask. In this paper, we study the benefits of modeling uncertainty in neural network-based speech **enhancement**. For this, our neural network is trained to map a noisy spectrogram to the Wiener filter and its associated variance, which quantifies uncertainty, based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference of spectral coefficients. By estimating the distribution instead of the point estimate, one can model the uncertainty associated with each estimate. We further propose to use the estimated Wiener filter and its uncertainty to build an approximate MAP (A-MAP) estimator of spectral magnitudes, which in turn is combined with the MAP inference of spectral coefficients to form a hybrid loss function to jointly reinforce the estimation. Experimental results on different datasets show that the proposed method can not only capture the uncertainty associated with the estimated filters, but also yield a higher **enhancement** performance over comparable models that do not take uncertainty into account.

### Look\&Listen: Multi-Modal Correlation Learning for Active Speaker Detection and Speech **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2203.02216v1 [cs.SD])
- Authors : Junwen Xiong, Yu Zhou, Peng Zhang, Lei Xie, Wei Huang, Yufei Zha
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02216](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02216)
> ABSTRACT  :  Active speaker detection and speech **enhancement** have become two increasingly attractive topics in audio-visual scenario understanding. According to their respective characteristics, the scheme of independently designed architecture has been widely used in correspondence to each single task. This may lead to the learned feature representation being task-specific, and inevitably result in the lack of generalization ability of the feature based on multi-modal modeling. More recent studies have shown that establishing cross-modal relationship between auditory and visual stream is a promising solution for the challenge of audio-visual multi-task learning. Therefore, as a motivation to bridge the multi-modal cross-attention, in this work, a unified framework ADENet is proposed to achieve target speaker detection and speech **enhancement** with joint learning of audio-visual modeling.
