> ABSTRACT  :  This paper proposes a fast eye detection method based on fully-convolutional Siamese networks for iris recognition. The iris on the move system requires to capture high resolution iris images from a moving subject for iris recognition. Therefore, capturing images contains both eyes at high-frame-rate increases the chance of iris imaging. In order to output the authentication result in **real time**, the system requires a fast eye detector extracting the left and right eye regions from the image. Our method extracts features of a partial face image and a reference eye image using Siamese network frameworks. Similarity heat maps of both eyes are created by calculating the spatial cosine similarity between extracted features. Besides, we use CosFace as a loss function for training to discriminate the left and right eyes with high accuracy even with a shallow network. Experimental results show that our method trained by CosFace is fast and accurate compared with conventional generic object detection methods.

> ABSTRACT  :  Deep learning based fall detection is one of the crucial tasks for intelligent video surveillance systems, which aims to detect unintentional falls of humans and alarm dangerous situations. In this work, we propose a simple and efficient framework to detect falls through a single and small-sized convolutional neural network. To this end, we first introduce a new image synthesis method that represents human motion in a single frame. This simplifies the fall detection task as an image classification task. Besides, the proposed synthetic data generation method enables to generate a sufficient amount of training dataset, resulting in satisfactory performance even with the small model. At the inference step, we also represent real human motion in a single image by estimating mean of input frames. In the experiment, we conduct both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on URFD and AIHub airport datasets to show the effectiveness of our method.

> ABSTRACT  :  Implicit neural representations such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) have focused mainly on modeling static objects captured under multi-view settings where real-time rendering can be achieved with smart data structures, e.g., PlenOctree. In this paper, we present a novel Fourier PlenOctree (FPO) technique to tackle efficient neural modeling and real-time rendering of dynamic scenes captured under the free-view video (FVV) setting. The key idea in our FPO is a novel combination of generalized NeRF, PlenOctree representation, volumetric fusion and Fourier transform. To accelerate FPO construction, we present a novel coarse-to-fine fusion scheme that leverages the generalizable NeRF technique to generate the tree via spatial blending. To tackle dynamic scenes, we tailor the implicit network to model the Fourier coefficients of timevarying density and color attributes. Finally, we construct the FPO and train the Fourier coefficients directly on the leaves of a union PlenOctree structure of the dynamic sequence. We show that the resulting FPO enables compact memory overload to handle dynamic objects and supports efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method is 3000 times faster than the original NeRF and achieves over an order of magnitude acceleration over SOTA while preserving high visual quality for the free-viewpoint rendering of unseen dynamic scenes.

### Ghost projection. II. Beam shaping using realistic spatially-random masks. (arXiv:2202.10572v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors : David Ceddia, Daniele Pelliccia, Alexander Rack
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10572](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10572)
> ABSTRACT  :  The spatial light modulator and optical data projector both rely on precisely configurable optical elements to shape a light beam. Here we explore an image-projection approach which does not require a configurable beam-shaping element. We term this approach {\em ghost projection} on account of its conceptual relation to computational ghost imaging. Instead of a configurable beam shaping element, the method transversely displaces a single illuminated mask, such as a spatially-random screen, to create specified distributions of radiant **exposure**. The method has potential applicability to image projection employing a variety of radiation and matter wave fields, such as hard x rays, neutrons, muons, atomic beams and molecular beams. Building on our previous theoretical and computational studies, we here seek to understand the effects, sensitivity, and tolerance of some key experimental limitations of the method. Focusing on the case of hard x rays, we employ experimentally acquired masks to numerically study the deleterious effects of photon shot noise, inaccuracies in random-mask **exposure** time, and inaccuracies in mask positioning, as well as adapting to spatially non-uniform illumination. Understanding the influence of these factors will assist in optimizing experimental design and work towards achieving ghost projection in practice.

### A framework for spatial heat risk assessment using a generalized similarity measure. (arXiv:2202.10963v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Akshay Bansal, Ayda Kianmehr
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10963](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10963)
> ABSTRACT  :  In this study, we develop a novel framework to assess health risks due to heat hazards across various localities (zip codes) across the state of Maryland with the help of two commonly used indicators i.e. **exposure** and vulnerability. Our approach quantifies each of the two aforementioned indicators by developing their corresponding feature vectors and subsequently computes indicator-specific reference vectors that signify a high risk environment by clustering the data points at the tail-end of an empirical risk spectrum. The proposed framework circumvents the information-theoretic entropy based aggregation methods whose usage varies with different views of entropy that are subjective in nature and more importantly generalizes the notion of risk-valuation using cosine similarity with unknown reference points.  
### Back2Future: Leveraging Backfill Dynamics for Improving **Real-time** Predictions in Future. (arXiv:2106.04420v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)
- Authors : Harshavardhan Kamarthi, Alexander Rodr, Aditya Prakash
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04420](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04420)
> ABSTRACT  :  In real-time forecasting in public health, data collection is a non-trivial and demanding task. Often after initially released, it undergoes several revisions later (maybe due to human or technical constraints) - as a result, it may take weeks until the data reaches to a stable value. This so-called 'backfill' phenomenon and its effect on model performance has been barely studied in the prior literature. In this paper, we introduce the multi-variate backfill problem using COVID-19 as the motivating example. We construct a detailed dataset composed of relevant signals over the past year of the pandemic. We then systematically characterize several patterns in backfill dynamics and leverage our observations for formulating a novel problem and neural framework Back2Future that aims to refines a given model's predictions in real-time. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method refines the performance of top models for COVID-19 forecasting, in contrast to non-trivial baselines, yielding 18% improvement over baselines, enabling us obtain a new SOTA performance. In addition, we show that our model improves model evaluation too; hence policy-makers can better understand the true accuracy of forecasting models in real-time.  
### RemixIT: Continual self-training of speech **enhancement** models via bootstrapped remixing. (arXiv:2202.08862v2 [cs.SD] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08862](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08862)
> ABSTRACT  :  We present RemixIT, a simple yet effective self-supervised method for training speech **enhancement** without the need of a single isolated in-domain speech nor a noise waveform. Our approach overcomes limitations of previous methods which make them dependent on clean in-domain target signals and thus, sensitive to any domain mismatch between train and test samples. RemixIT is based on a continuous self-training scheme in which a pre-trained teacher model on out-of-domain data infers estimated pseudo-target signals for in-domain mixtures. Then, by permuting the estimated clean and noise signals and remixing them together, we generate a new set of bootstrapped mixtures and corresponding pseudo-targets which are used to train the student network. Vice-versa, the teacher periodically refines its estimates using the updated parameters of the latest student models. Experimental results on multiple speech **enhancement** datasets and tasks not only show the superiority of our method over prior approaches but also showcase that RemixIT can be combined with any separation model as well as be applied towards any semi-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation task. Our analysis, paired with empirical evidence, sheds light on the inside functioning of our self-training scheme wherein the student model keeps obtaining better performance while observing severely degraded pseudo-targets.

### Improving Character Error Rate Is Not Equal to Having Clean Speech: Speech **Enhancement** for ASR Systems with Black-box Acoustic Models. (arXiv:2110.05968v2 [eess.AS] UPDATED)
- Authors : Ryosuke Sawata, Yosuke Kashiwagi, Shusuke Takahashi
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05968](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05968)
> ABSTRACT  :  A deep neural network (DNN)-based speech **enhancement** (SE) aiming to maximize the performance of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is proposed in this paper. In order to optimize the DNN-based SE model in terms of the character error rate (CER), which is one of the metric to evaluate the ASR system and generally non-differentiable, our method uses two DNNs: one for speech processing and one for mimicking the output CERs derived through an acoustic model (AM). Then both of DNNs are alternately optimized in the training phase. Even if the AM is a black-box, e.g., like one provided by a third-party, the proposed method enables the DNN-based SE model to be optimized in terms of the CER since the DNN mimicking the AM is differentiable. Consequently, it becomes feasible to build CER-centric SE model that has no negative effect, e.g., additional calculation cost and changing network architecture, on the inference phase since our method is merely a training scheme for the existing DNN-based methods. Experimental results show that our method improved CER by 8.8% relative derived through a black-box AM although certain noise levels are kept.
