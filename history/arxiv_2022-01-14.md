### Partial-Attribution Instance Segmentation for Astronomical Source Detection and Deblending. (arXiv:2201.04714v1 [astro-ph.IM])
- Authors : Ryan Hausen, Brant Robertson

> ABSTRACT  :  Astronomical source deblending is the process of separating the contribution of individual stars or galaxies (sources) to an image comprised of multiple, possibly overlapping sources. Astronomical sources display a wide range of sizes and brightnesses and may show substantial overlap in images. Astronomical imaging data can further challenge off-the-shelf computer vision algorithms owing to its **high dynamic range**, low signal-to-noise ratio, and unconventional image format. These challenges make source deblending an open area of astronomical research, and in this work, we introduce a new approach called Partial-Attribution Instance Segmentation that enables source detection and deblending in a manner tractable for deep learning models. We provide a novel neural network implementation as a demonstration of the method.  
### VoLux-GAN: A Generative Model for 3D Face Synthesis with **HDR**I Relighting. (arXiv:2201.04873v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Feitong Tan, Sean Fanello, Abhimitra Meka, Sergio Orts, Danhang Tang, Rohit Pandey, Jonathan Taylor, Ping Tan, Yinda Zhang
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04873](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04873)
> ABSTRACT  :  We propose VoLux-GAN, a generative framework to synthesize 3D-aware faces with convincing relighting. Our main contribution is a volumetric **HDR**I relighting method that can efficiently accumulate albedo, diffuse and specular lighting contributions along each 3D ray for any desired **HDR** environmental map. Additionally, we show the importance of supervising the image decomposition process using multiple discriminators. In particular, we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages recent advances in single image portrait relighting to enforce consistent geometry, albedo, diffuse and specular components. Multiple experiments and comparisons with other generative frameworks show how our model is a step forward towards photorealistic relightable 3D generative models.

> ABSTRACT  :  Estimating the lung depth on x-ray images could provide both an accurate opportunistic lung volume estimation during clinical routine and improve image contrast in modern structural chest imaging techniques like x-ray **dark**-field imaging. We present a method based on a convolutional neural network that allows a per-pixel lung thickness estimation and subsequent total lung capacity estimation. The network was trained and validated using 5250 simulated radiographs generated from 525 real CT scans. Furthermore, we are able to infer the model trained with simulation data on real radiographs.    For 45 patients, quantitative and qualitative evaluation was performed on standard clinical radiographs. The ground-truth for each patient's total lung volume was defined based on the patients' corresponding CT scan. The mean-absolute error between the estimated lung volume on the 45 real radiographs and groundtruth volume was 0.83 liter. When accounting for the patient diameter, the error decreases to 0.66 liter. Additionaly, we predicted the lung thicknesses on a synthetic dataset of 131 radiographs, where the mean-absolute error was 0.21 liter. The results show, that it is possible to transfer the knowledge obtained in a simulation model to real x-ray images.

### Indirect Domain Shift for Single Image Dehazing. (arXiv:2102.03268v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Huan Liu, Jun Chen
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03268](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03268)
> ABSTRACT  :  Despite their remarkable expressibility, convolution neural networks (CNNs) still fall short of delivering satisfactory results on single image dehazing, especially in terms of faithful recovery of fine texture details. In this paper, we argue that the inadequacy of conventional CNN-based dehazing methods can be attributed to the fact that the domain of hazy images is too far away from that of clear images, rendering it difficult to train a CNN for learning direct domain shift through an end-to-end manner and recovering texture details simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose to add explicit constraints inside a deep CNN model to guide the **restoration** process. In contrast to direct learning, the proposed mechanism shifts and narrows the candidate region for the estimation output via multiple confident neighborhoods. Therefore, it is capable of consolidating the expressibility of different architectures, resulting in a more accurate indirect domain shift (IDS) from the hazy images to that of clear images. We also propose two different training schemes, including hard IDS and soft IDS, which further reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our extensive experimental results indicate that the dehazing method based on this mechanism outperforms the state-of-the-arts.  
### Scalable Image Coding for Humans and Machines. (arXiv:2107.08373v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Hyomin Choi
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08373](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08373)
> ABSTRACT  :  At present, and increasingly so in the future, much of the captured visual content will not be seen by humans. Instead, it will be used for automated machine vision analytics and may require occasional human viewing. Examples of such applications include traffic monitoring, visual surveillance, autonomous navigation, and industrial machine vision. To address such requirements, we develop an end-to-end learned image codec whose latent space is designed to support scalability from simpler to more complicated tasks. The simplest task is assigned to a subset of the latent space (the base layer), while more complicated tasks make use of additional subsets of the latent space, i.e., both the base and **enhancement** layer(s). For the experiments, we establish a 2-layer and a 3-layer model, each of which offers input reconstruction for human vision, plus machine vision task(s), and compare them with relevant benchmarks. The experiments show that our scalable codecs offer 37%-80% bitrate savings on machine vision tasks compared to best alternatives, while being comparable to state-of-the-art image codecs in terms of input reconstruction.

### REST: Debiased Social Recommendation via Reconstructing **Exposure** Strategies. (arXiv:2201.04952v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Ruichu Cai, Fengzhu Wu, Zijian Li, Jie Qiao, Wei Chen, Yuexing Hao, Hao Gu

> ABSTRACT  :  The recommendation system, relying on historical observational data to model the complex relationships among the users and items, has achieved great success in real-world applications. Selection bias is one of the most important issues of the existing observational data based approaches, which is actually caused by multiple types of unobserved **exposure** strategies (e.g. promotions and holiday effects). Though various methods have been proposed to address this problem, they are mainly relying on the implicit debiasing techniques but not explicitly modeling the unobserved **exposure** strategies. By explicitly Reconstructing **Exposure** STrategies (REST in short), we formalize the recommendation problem as the counterfactual reasoning and propose the debiased social recommendation method. In REST, we assume that the **exposure** of an item is controlled by the latent **exposure** strategies, the user, and the item. Based on the above generation process, we first provide the theoretical guarantee of our method via identification analysis. Second, we employ a variational auto-encoder to reconstruct the latent **exposure** strategies, with the help of the social networks and the items. Third, we devise a counterfactual reasoning based recommendation algorithm by leveraging the recovered **exposure** strategies. Experiments on four real-world datasets, including three published datasets and one private WeChat Official Account dataset, demonstrate significant improvements over several state-of-the-art methods.

### The Effectiveness of Time Stretching for Enhancing Dysarthric Speech for Improved Dysarthric Speech Recognition. (arXiv:2201.04908v1 [cs.SD])
- Authors : Luke Prananta, Bence Mark, Siyuan Feng, Odette Scharenborg
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04908](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04908)
> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we investigate several existing and a new state-of-the-art generative adversarial network-based (GAN) voice conversion method for enhancing dysarthric speech for improved dysarthric speech recognition. We compare key components of existing methods as part of a rigorous ablation study to find the most effective solution to improve dysarthric speech recognition. We find that straightforward signal processing methods such as stationary noise removal and vocoder-based time stretching lead to dysarthric speech recognition results comparable to those obtained when using state-of-the-art GAN-based voice conversion methods as measured using a phoneme recognition task. Additionally, our proposed solution of a combination of MaskCycleGAN-VC and time stretched **enhancement** is able to improve the phoneme recognition results for certain dysarthric speakers compared to our time stretched baseline.
