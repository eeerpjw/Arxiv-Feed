### Learning Spatially Varying Pixel **Exposure**s for Motion Deblurring. (arXiv:2204.07267v1 [eess.IV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Computationally removing the motion blur introduced by camera shake or object motion in a captured image remains a challenging task in computational photography. Deblurring methods are often limited by the fixed global **exposure** time of the image capture process. The post-processing algorithm either must deblur a longer **exposure** that contains relatively little noise or denoise a short **exposure** that intentionally removes the opportunity for blur at the cost of increased noise. We present a novel approach of leveraging spatially varying pixel **exposure**s for motion deblurring using next-generation focal-plane sensor--processors along with an end-to-end design of these **exposure**s and a machine learning--based motion-deblurring framework. We demonstrate in simulation and a physical prototype that learned spatially varying pixel **exposure**s (L-SVPE) can successfully deblur scenes while recovering high frequency detail. Our work illustrates the promising role that focal-plane sensor--processors can play in the future of computational imaging.

> ABSTRACT  :  Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) aims to facilitate the training and deployment of object detectors with the help of a large amount of unlabeled data. Though various self-training based and consistency-regularization based SSOD methods have been proposed, most of them are anchor-based detectors, ignoring the fact that in many real-world applications anchor-free detectors are more demanded. In this paper, we intend to bridge this gap and propose a DenSe Learning (DSL) based anchor-free SSOD algorithm. Specifically, we achieve this goal by introducing several novel techniques, including an Adaptive Filtering strategy for assigning multi-level and accurate dense pixel-wise pseudo-labels, an Aggregated Teacher for producing stable and precise pseudo-labels, and an uncertainty-consistency-regularization term among scales and shuffled patches for improving the generalization capability of the detector. Extensive experiments are conducted on MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC, and the results show that our proposed DSL method records new state-of-the-art SSOD performance, surpassing existing methods by a large margin. Codes can be found at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/chenbinghui1/DSL}.

> ABSTRACT  :  Multi-camera vehicle tracking is one of the most complicated tasks in Computer Vision as it involves distinct tasks including Vehicle Detection, Tracking, and Re-identification. Despite the challenges, multi-camera vehicle tracking has immense potential in transportation applications including speed, volume, origin-destination (O-D), and routing data generation. Several recent works have addressed the multi-camera tracking problem. However, most of the effort has gone towards improving accuracy on high-quality benchmark datasets while disregarding lower camera resolutions, compression artifacts and the overwhelming amount of computational power and time needed to carry out this task on its edge and thus making it prohibitive for large-scale and real-time deployment. Therefore, in this work we shed light on practical issues that should be addressed for the design of a multi-camera tracking system to provide actionable and timely insights. Moreover, we propose a real-time city-scale multi-camera vehicle tracking system that compares favorably to computationally intensive alternatives and handles real-world, low-resolution CCTV instead of idealized and curated video streams. To show its effectiveness, in addition to integration into the Regional Integrated Transportation Information System (RITIS), we participated in the 2021 NVIDIA AI City multi-camera tracking challenge and our method is ranked among the top five performers on the public leaderboard.

> ABSTRACT  :  Ambient lighting conditions play a crucial role in determining the perceptual quality of images from photographic devices. In general, inadequate transmission light and undesired atmospheric conditions jointly degrade the image quality. If we know the desired ambient factors associated with the given **low-light** image, we can recover the enhanced image easily \cite{b1}. Typical deep networks perform **enhancement** mappings without investigating the light distribution and color formulation properties. This leads to a lack of image instance-adaptive performance in practice. On the other hand, physical model-driven schemes suffer from the need for inherent decompositions and multiple objective minimizations. Moreover, the above approaches are rarely data efficient or free of postprediction tuning. Influenced by the above issues, this study presents a semisupervised training method using no-reference image quality metrics for **low-light** image **restoration**. We incorporate the classical haze distribution model \cite{b2} to explore the physical properties of the given image in order to learn the effect of atmospheric components and minimize a single objective for **restoration**. We validate the performance of our network for six widely used **low-light** datasets. The experiments show that the proposed study achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance.  
### Can You Spot the Chameleon? Adversarially Camouflaging Images from Co-Salient Object Detection. (arXiv:2009.09258v4 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Co-salient object detection (CoSOD) has recently achieved significant progress and played a key role in retrieval-related tasks. However, it inevitably poses an entirely new safety and security issue, i.e., highly personal and sensitive content can potentially be extracting by powerful CoSOD methods. In this paper, we address this problem from the perspective of adversarial attacks and identify a novel task: adversarial co-saliency attack. Specially, given an image selected from a group of images containing some common and salient objects, we aim to generate an adversarial version that can mislead CoSOD methods to predict incorrect co-salient regions. Note that, compared with general white-box adversarial attacks for classification, this new task faces two additional challenges: (1) low success rate due to the diverse appearance of images in the group; (2) low transferability across CoSOD methods due to the considerable difference between CoSOD pipelines. To address these challenges, we propose the very first black-box joint adversarial **exposure** and noise attack (Jadena), where we jointly and locally tune the **exposure** and additive perturbations of the image according to a newly designed high-feature-level contrast-sensitive loss function. Our method, without any information on the state-of-the-art CoSOD methods, leads to significant performance degradation on various co-saliency detection datasets and makes the co-salient objects undetectable. This can have strong practical benefits in properly securing the large number of personal photos currently shared on the Internet. Moreover, our method is potential to be utilized as a metric for evaluating the robustness of CoSOD methods.  
### Nanorobot queue: Cooperative treatment of cancer based on team member communication and image processing. (arXiv:2111.11236v3 [cs.RO] UPDATED)
- Authors : Xinyu Zhou
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11236](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11236)
> ABSTRACT  :  Although nanorobots have been used as clinical prescriptions for work such as gastroscopy, and even photoacoustic tomography technology has been proposed to control nanorobots to deliver drugs at designated delivery points in **real time**, and there are cases of eliminating "superbacteria" in blood through nanorobots, most technologies are immature, either with low efficiency or low accuracy, Either it can not be mass produced, so the most effective way to treat cancer diseases at this stage is through chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients are suffering and can not be cured. Therefore, this paper proposes an ideal model of a treatment method that can completely cure cancer, a cooperative treatment method based on nano robot queue through team member communication and computer vision image classification (target detection).

> ABSTRACT  :  Decreasing projection views to lower X-ray radiation dose usually leads to severe streak artifacts. To improve image quality from sparse-view data, a Multi-domain Integrative **Swin** Transformer network (MIST-net) was developed in this article. First, MIST-net incorporated lavish domain features from data, residual-data, image, and residual-image using flexible network architectures, where residual-data and residual-image sub-network was considered as data consistency module to eliminate interpolation and reconstruction errors. Second, a trainable edge **enhancement** filter was incorporated to detect and protect image edges. Third, a high-quality reconstruction **Swin** transformer (i.e., Recformer) was designed to capture image global features. The experiment results on numerical and real cardiac clinical datasets with 48-views demonstrated that our proposed MIST-net provided better image quality with more small features and sharp edges than other competitors.

### Causal Disentanglement with Network Information for Debiased Recommendations. (arXiv:2204.07221v1 [cs.IR])
- Authors : Paras Sheth, Ruocheng Guo, Lu Cheng, Huan Liu, uk Candan

> ABSTRACT  :  Recommender systems aim to recommend new items to users by learning user and item representations. In practice, these representations are highly entangled as they consist of information about multiple factors, including user's interests, item attributes along with confounding factors such as user conformity, and item popularity. Considering these entangled representations for inferring user preference may lead to biased recommendations (e.g., when the recommender model recommends popular items even if they do not align with the user's interests).    Recent research proposes to debias by modeling a recommender system from a causal perspective. The **exposure** and the ratings are analogous to the treatment and the outcome in the causal inference framework, respectively. The critical challenge in this setting is accounting for the hidden confounders. These confounders are unobserved, making it hard to measure them. On the other hand, since these confounders affect both the **exposure** and the ratings, it is essential to account for them in generating debiased recommendations. To better approximate hidden confounders, we propose to leverage network information (i.e., user-social and user-item networks), which are shown to influence how users discover and interact with an item. Aside from the user conformity, aspects of confounding such as item popularity present in the network information is also captured in our method with the aid of \textit{causal disentanglement} which unravels the learned representations into independent factors that are responsible for (a) modeling the **exposure** of an item to the user, (b) predicting the ratings, and (c) controlling the hidden confounders. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model for debiasing recommender systems.
