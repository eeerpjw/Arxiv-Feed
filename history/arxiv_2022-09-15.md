### Reflectance-Guided, Contrast-Accumulated Histogram Equalization. (arXiv:2209.06405v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Xiaomeng Wu, Takahito Kawanishi, Kunio Kashino

> ABSTRACT  :  Existing image **enhancement** methods fall short of expectations because with them it is difficult to improve global and local image contrast simultaneously. To address this problem, we propose a histogram equalization-based method that adapts to the data-dependent requirements of brightness **enhancement** and improves the visibility of details without losing the global contrast. This method incorporates the spatial information provided by image context in density estimation for discriminative histogram equalization. To minimize the adverse effect of non-uniform illumination, we propose defining spatial information on the basis of image reflectance estimated with edge preserving smoothing. Our method works particularly well for determining how the background brightness should be adaptively adjusted and for revealing useful image details hidden in the **dark**.  
### Reflectance-Oriented Probabilistic Equalization for Image **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2209.06406v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Despite recent advances in image **enhancement**, it remains difficult for existing approaches to adaptively improve the brightness and contrast for both **low-light** and normal-light images. To solve this problem, we propose a novel 2D histogram equalization approach. It assumes intensity occurrence and co-occurrence to be dependent on each other and derives the distribution of intensity occurrence (1D histogram) by marginalizing over the distribution of intensity co-occurrence (2D histogram). This scheme improves global contrast more effectively and reduces noise amplification. The 2D histogram is defined by incorporating the local pixel value differences in image reflectance into the density estimation to alleviate the adverse effects of **dark** lighting conditions. Over 500 images were used for evaluation, demonstrating the superiority of our approach over existing studies. It can sufficiently improve the brightness of **low-light** images while avoiding over-**enhancement** in normal-light images.  
### Continuous longitudinal fetus brain atlas construction via **implicit neural representation**. (arXiv:2209.06413v1 [eess.IV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Longitudinal fetal brain atlas is a powerful tool for understanding and characterizing the complex process of fetus brain development. Existing fetus brain atlases are typically constructed by averaged brain images on discrete time points independently over time. Due to the differences in onto-genetic trends among samples at different time points, the resulting atlases suffer from temporal inconsistency, which may lead to estimating error of the brain developmental characteristic parameters along the timeline. To this end, we proposed a multi-stage deep-learning framework to tackle the time inconsistency issue as a 4D (3D brain volume + 1D age) image data denoising task. Using **implicit neural representation**, we construct a continuous and noise-free longitudinal fetus brain atlas as a function of the 4D spatial-temporal coordinate. Experimental results on two public fetal brain atlases (CRL and FBA-Chinese atlases) show that the proposed method can significantly improve the atlas temporal consistency while maintaining good fetus brain structure representation. In addition, the continuous longitudinal fetus brain atlases can also be extensively applied to generate finer 4D atlases in both spatial and temporal resolution.  
### INV-Flow2PoseNet: Light-Resistant Rigid Object Pose from Optical Flow of RGB-D Images using Images, Normals and Vertices. (arXiv:2209.06562v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  This paper presents a novel architecture for simultaneous estimation of highly accurate optical flows and rigid scene transformations for difficult scenarios where the brightness assumption is violated by strong shading changes. In the case of rotating objects or moving light sources, such as those encountered for driving cars in the **dark**, the scene appearance often changes significantly from one view to the next. Unfortunately, standard methods for calculating optical flows or poses are based on the expectation that the appearance of features in the scene remain constant between views. These methods may fail frequently in the investigated cases. The presented method fuses texture and geometry information by combining image, vertex and normal data to compute an illumination-invariant optical flow. By using a coarse-to-fine strategy, globally anchored optical flows are learned, reducing the impact of erroneous shading-based pseudo-correspondences. Based on the learned optical flows, a second architecture is proposed that predicts robust rigid transformations from the warped vertex and normal maps. Particular attention is payed to situations with strong rotations, which often cause such shading changes. Therefore a 3-step procedure is proposed that profitably exploits correlations between the normals and vertices. The method has been evaluated on a newly created dataset containing both synthetic and real data with strong rotations and shading effects. This data represents the typical use case in 3D reconstruction, where the object often rotates in large steps between the partial reconstructions. Additionally, we apply the method to the well-known Kitti Odometry dataset. Even if, due to fulfillment of the brighness assumption, this is not the typical use case of the method, the applicability to standard situations and the relation to other methods is therefore established.  
### CMR3D: Contextualized Multi-Stage Refinement for 3D Object Detection. (arXiv:2209.06641v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Existing deep learning-based 3D object detectors typically rely on the appearance of individual objects and do not explicitly pay attention to the rich contextual information of the scene. In this work, we propose Contextualized Multi-Stage Refinement for 3D Object Detection (CMR3D) framework, which takes a 3D scene as input and strives to explicitly integrate useful contextual information of the scene at multiple levels to predict a set of object bounding-boxes along with their corresponding semantic labels. To this end, we propose to utilize a context **enhancement** network that captures the contextual information at different levels of granularity followed by a multi-stage refinement module to progressively refine the box positions and class predictions. Extensive experiments on the large-scale ScanNetV2 benchmark reveal the benefits of our proposed method, leading to an absolute improvement of 2.0% over the baseline. In addition to 3D object detection, we investigate the effectiveness of our CMR3D framework for the problem of 3D object counting. Our source code will be publicly released.  
### Content-aware Directed Propagation Network with Pixel Adaptive Kernel Attention. (arXiv:2107.13144v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been not only widespread but also achieved noticeable results on numerous applications including image classification, **restoration**, and generation. Although the weight-sharing property of convolutions makes them widely adopted in various tasks, its content-agnostic characteristic can also be considered a major drawback. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel operation, called pixel adaptive kernel attention (PAKA). PAKA provides directivity to the filter weights by multiplying spatially varying attention from learnable features. The proposed method infers pixel-adaptive attention maps along the channel and spatial directions separately to address the decomposed model with fewer parameters. Our method is trainable in an end-to-end manner and applicable to any CNN-based models. In addition, we propose an improved information aggregation module with PAKA, called the hierarchical PAKA module (HPM). We demonstrate the superiority of our HPM by presenting state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation compared to the conventional information aggregation modules. We validate the proposed method through additional ablation studies and visualizing the effect of PAKA providing directivity to the weights of convolutions. We also show the generalizability of the proposed method by applying it to multi-modal tasks especially color-guided depth map super-resolution.  
### Generalised Image Outpainting with U-Transformer. (arXiv:2201.11403v5 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we develop a novel transformer-based generative adversarial neural network called U-Transformer for generalised image outpainting problem. Different from most present image outpainting methods conducting horizontal extrapolation, our generalised image outpainting could extrapolate visual context all-side around a given image with plausible structure and details even for complicated scenery, building, and art images. Specifically, we design a generator as an encoder-to-decoder structure embedded with the popular **Swin** Transformer blocks. As such, our novel neural network can better cope with image long-range dependencies which are crucially important for generalised image outpainting. We propose additionally a U-shaped structure and multi-view Temporal Spatial Predictor (TSP) module to reinforce image self-reconstruction as well as unknown-part prediction smoothly and realistically. By adjusting the predicting step in the TSP module in the testing stage, we can generate arbitrary outpainting size given the input sub-image. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed method could produce visually appealing results for generalized image outpainting against the state-of-the-art image outpainting approaches.  
### Audiogram Digitization Tool for Audiological Reports. (arXiv:2208.14621v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  A number of private and public insurers compensate workers whose hearing loss can be directly attributed to excessive **exposure** to noise in the workplace. The claim assessment process is typically lengthy and requires significant effort from human adjudicators who must interpret hand-recorded audiograms, often sent via fax or equivalent. In this work, we present a solution developed in partnership with the Workplace Safety Insurance Board of Ontario to streamline the adjudication process. In particular, we present the first audiogram digitization algorithm capable of automatically extracting the hearing thresholds from a scanned or faxed audiology report as a proof-of-concept. The algorithm extracts most thresholds within 5 dB accuracy, allowing to substantially lessen the time required to convert an audiogram into digital format in a semi-supervised fashion, and is a first step towards the automation of the adjudication process. The source code for the digitization algorithm and a desktop-based implementation of our NIHL annotation portal is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/GreenCUBIC/AudiogramDigitization).

### Removing the fat from your posterior samples with margarine. (arXiv:2205.12841v2 [astro-ph.IM] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Bayesian workflows often require the introduction of nuisance parameters, yet for core science modelling one needs access to a marginal posterior density. In this work we use masked autoregressive flows and kernel density estimators to encapsulate the marginal posterior, allowing us to compute marginal Kullback-Leibler divergences and marginal Bayesian model dimensionalities in addition to generating samples and computing marginal log probabilities. We demonstrate this in application to topical cosmological examples of the **Dark** Energy Survey, and global 21cm signal experiments. In addition to the computation of marginal Bayesian statistics, this work is important for further applications in Bayesian experimental design, complex prior modelling and likelihood emulation. This technique is made publicly available in the pip-installable code margarine.
