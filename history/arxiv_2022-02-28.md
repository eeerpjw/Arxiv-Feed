> ABSTRACT  :  Traditional knowledge distillation transfers "**dark** knowledge" of a pre-trained teacher network to a student network, and ignores the knowledge in the training process of the teacher, which we call teacher's experience. However, in realistic educational scenarios, learning experience is often more important than learning results. In this work, we propose a novel knowledge distillation method by integrating the teacher's experience for knowledge transfer, named experience ensemble knowledge distillation (EEKD). We save a moderate number of intermediate models from the training process of the teacher model uniformly, and then integrate the knowledge of these intermediate models by ensemble technique. A self-attention module is used to adaptively assign weights to different intermediate models in the process of knowledge transfer. Three principles of constructing EEKD on the quality, weights and number of intermediate models are explored. A surprising conclusion is found that strong ensemble teachers do not necessarily produce strong students. The experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show that EEKD outperforms the mainstream knowledge distillation methods and achieves the state-of-the-art. In particular, EEKD even surpasses the standard ensemble distillation on the premise of saving training cost.

> ABSTRACT  :  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) perform very well in image classification and object detection in recent years, but even the most advanced models have limited rotation invariance. Known solutions include the **enhancement** of training data and the increase of rotation invariance by globally merging the rotation equivariant features. These methods either increase the workload of training or increase the number of model parameters. To address this problem, this paper proposes a module that can be inserted into the existing networks, and directly incorporates the rotation invariance into the feature extraction layers of the CNNs. This module does not have learnable parameters and will not increase the complexity of the model. At the same time, only by training the upright data, it can perform well on the rotated testing set. These advantages will be suitable for fields such as biomedicine and astronomy where it is difficult to obtain upright samples or the target has no directionality. Evaluate our module with LeNet-5, ResNet-18 and tiny-yolov3, we get impressive results.  
### Local Intensity Order Transformation for Robust Curvilinear Object Segmentation. (arXiv:2202.12587v1 [eess.IV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Segmentation of curvilinear structures is important in many applications, such as retinal blood vessel segmentation for early detection of vessel diseases and pavement crack segmentation for road condition evaluation and maintenance. Currently, deep learning-based methods have achieved impressive performance on these tasks. Yet, most of them mainly focus on finding powerful deep architectures but ignore capturing the inherent curvilinear structure feature (e.g., the curvilinear structure is **dark**er than the context) for a more robust representation. In consequence, the performance usually drops a lot on cross-datasets, which poses great challenges in practice. In this paper, we aim to improve the generalizability by introducing a novel local intensity order transformation (LIOT). Specifically, we transfer a gray-scale image into a contrast-invariant four-channel image based on the intensity order between each pixel and its nearby pixels along with the four (horizontal and vertical) directions. This results in a representation that preserves the inherent characteristic of the curvilinear structure while being robust to contrast changes. Cross-dataset evaluation on three retinal blood vessel segmentation datasets demonstrates that LIOT improves the generalizability of some state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the cross-dataset evaluation between retinal blood vessel segmentation and pavement crack segmentation shows that LIOT is able to preserve the inherent characteristic of curvilinear structure with large appearance gaps. An implementation of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/TY-Shi/LIOT.  
### Deep Dirichlet uncertainty for unsupervised out-of-distribution detection of eye fundus photographs in glaucoma screening. (arXiv:2202.12634v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Teresa Ara, Guilherme Aresta, Hrvoje Bogunovic
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12634](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12634)
> ABSTRACT  :  The development of automatic tools for early glaucoma diagnosis with color fundus photographs can significantly reduce the impact of this disease. However, current state-of-the-art solutions are not robust to real-world scenarios, providing over-confident predictions for out-of-distribution cases. With this in mind, we propose a model based on the Dirichlet distribution that allows to obtain class-wise probabilities together with an uncertainty estimation without **exposure** to out-of-distribution cases. We demonstrate our approach on the AIROGS challenge. At the start of the final test phase (8 Feb. 2022), our method had the highest average score among all submissions.  
### Phrase-Based Affordance Detection via Cyclic **Bilateral** Interaction. (arXiv:2202.12076v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Affordance detection, which refers to perceiving objects with potential action possibilities in images, is a challenging task since the possible affordance depends on the person's purpose in real-world application scenarios. The existing works mainly extract the inherent human-object dependencies from image/video to accommodate affordance properties that change dynamically. In this paper, we explore to perceive affordance from a vision-language perspective and consider the challenging phrase-based affordance detection problem,i.e., given a set of phrases describing the action purposes, all the object regions in a scene with the same affordance should be detected. To this end, we propose a cyclic **bilateral** consistency **enhancement** network (CBCE-Net) to align language and vision features progressively. Specifically, the presented CBCE-Net consists of a mutual guided vision-language module that updates the common features of vision and language in a progressive manner, and a cyclic interaction module (CIM) that facilitates the perception of possible interaction with objects in a cyclic manner. In addition, we extend the public Purpose-driven Affordance Dataset (PAD) by annotating affordance categories with short phrases. The contrastive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over nine typical methods from four relevant fields in terms of both objective metrics and visual quality. The related code and dataset will be released at \url{https://github.com/lulsheng/CBCE-Net}.

### Building a 3-Player Mahjong AI using Deep Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2202.12847v1 [cs.AI])
- Authors : Xiangyu Zhao
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12847](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12847)
> ABSTRACT  :  Mahjong is a popular multi-player imperfect-information game developed in China in the late 19th-century, with some very challenging features for AI research. Sanma, being a 3-player variant of the Japanese Riichi Mahjong, possesses unique characteristics including fewer tiles and, consequently, a more aggressive playing style. It is thus challenging and of great research interest in its own right, but has not yet been explored. In this paper, we present Meowjong, an AI for Sanma using deep reinforcement learning. We define an informative and compact 2-dimensional data structure for encoding the observable information in a Sanma game. We pre-train 5 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for Sanma's 5 actions -- discard, Pon, Kan, Kita and Riichi, and enhance the major action's model, namely the discard model, via self-play reinforcement learning using the Monte Carlo policy gradient method. Meowjong's models achieve test accuracies comparable with AIs for 4-player Mahjong through supervised learning, and gain a significant further **enhancement** from reinforcement learning. Being the first ever AI in Sanma, we claim that Meowjong stands as a state-of-the-art in this game.  
### Back2Future: Leveraging Backfill Dynamics for Improving **Real-time** Predictions in Future. (arXiv:2106.04420v5 [cs.LG] UPDATED)
- Authors : Harshavardhan Kamarthi, Alexander Rodr, Aditya Prakash
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04420](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04420)
> ABSTRACT  :  In real-time forecasting in public health, data collection is a non-trivial and demanding task. Often after initially released, it undergoes several revisions later (maybe due to human or technical constraints) - as a result, it may take weeks until the data reaches to a stable value. This so-called 'backfill' phenomenon and its effect on model performance has been barely studied in the prior literature. In this paper, we introduce the multi-variate backfill problem using COVID-19 as the motivating example. We construct a detailed dataset composed of relevant signals over the past year of the pandemic. We then systematically characterize several patterns in backfill dynamics and leverage our observations for formulating a novel problem and neural framework Back2Future that aims to refines a given model's predictions in real-time. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method refines the performance of top models for COVID-19 forecasting, in contrast to non-trivial baselines, yielding 18% improvement over baselines, enabling us obtain a new SOTA performance. In addition, we show that our model improves model evaluation too; hence policy-makers can better understand the true accuracy of forecasting models in real-time.
