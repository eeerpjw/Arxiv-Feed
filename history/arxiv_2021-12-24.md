### On Measuring and Controlling the Spectral Bias of the Deep Image Prior. (arXiv:2107.01125v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  The deep image prior showed that a randomly initialized network with a suitable architecture can be trained to solve inverse imaging problems by simply optimizing it's parameters to reconstruct a single degraded image. However, it suffers from two practical limitations. First, it remains unclear how to control the prior beyond the choice of the network architecture. Second, training requires an oracle stopping criterion as during the optimization the performance degrades after reaching an optimum value. To address these challenges we introduce a frequency-band correspondence measure to characterize the spectral bias of the deep image prior, where low-frequency image signals are learned faster and better than high-frequency counterparts. Based on our observations, we propose techniques to prevent the eventual performance degradation and accelerate convergence. We introduce a Lipschitz-controlled convolution layer and a Gaussian-controlled upsampling layer as plug-in replacements for layers used in the deep architectures. The experiments show that with these changes the performance does not degrade during optimization, relieving us from the need for an oracle stopping criterion. We further outline a stopping criterion to avoid superfluous computation. Finally, we show that our approach obtains favorable results compared to current approaches across various denoising, deblocking, inpainting, super-resolution and detail **enhancement** tasks. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/shizenglin/Measure-and-Control-Spectral-Bias}.  
### Improved YOLOv5 network for real-time multi-scale traffic sign detection. (arXiv:2112.08782v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Traffic sign detection is a challenging task for the unmanned driving system, especially for the detection of multi-scale targets and the real-time problem of detection. In the traffic sign detection process, the scale of the targets changes greatly, which will have a certain impact on the detection accuracy. Feature pyramid is widely used to solve this problem but it might break the feature consistency across different scales of traffic signs. Moreover, in practical application, it is difficult for common methods to improve the detection accuracy of multi-scale traffic signs while ensuring real-time detection. In this paper, we propose an improved feature pyramid model, named AF-FPN, which utilizes the adaptive attention module (AAM) and feature **enhancement** module (FEM) to reduce the information loss in the process of feature map generation and enhance the representation ability of the feature pyramid. We replaced the original feature pyramid network in YOLOv5 with AF-FPN, which improves the detection performance for multi-scale targets of the YOLOv5 network under the premise of ensuring real-time detection. Furthermore, a new automatic learning data augmentation method is proposed to enrich the dataset and improve the robustness of the model to make it more suitable for practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results on the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K (TT100K) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method when compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

### A Survey on Perceptually Optimized Video Coding. (arXiv:2112.12284v1 [cs.MM])
- Authors : Yun Zhang, Linwei Zhu, Gangyi Jiang, Sam Kwong, Jay Kuo

> ABSTRACT  :  Videos are developing in the trends of Ultra High Definition (UHD), High Frame Rate (HFR), **High Dynamic Range** (**HDR**), Wide Color Gammut (WCG) and high fidelity, which provide users with more realistic visual experiences. However, the amount of video data increases exponentially and requires high efficiency video compression for storage and network transmission. Perceptually optimized video coding aims to exploit visual redundancies in videos so as to maximize compression efficiency. In this paper, we present a systematic survey on the recent advances and challenges on perceptually optimized video coding. Firstly, we present problem formulation and framework of perceptually optimized video coding, which includes visual perception modelling, visual quality assessment and perception guided coding optimization. Secondly, the recent advances on visual factors, key computational visual models and quality assessment models are presented. Thirdly, we do systematic review on perceptual video coding optimizations from four key aspects, which includes perceptually optimized bit allocation, rate-distortion optimization, transform and quantization, filtering and **enhancement**. In each part, problem formulation, working flow, recent advances, advantages and challenges are presented. Fourthly, perceptual coding performance of latest coding standards and tools are experimentally analyzed. Finally, challenging issues and future opportunities on perceptual video coding are identified.
