### Seg4Reg+: Consistency Learning between Spine Segmentation and Cobb Angle Regression. (arXiv:2208.12462v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Automated methods for Cobb angle estimation are of high demand for scoliosis assessment. Existing methods typically calculate the Cobb angle from landmark estimation, or simply combine the low-level task (e.g., landmark detection and spine segmentation) with the Cobb angle regression task, without fully exploring the benefits from each other. In this study, we propose a novel multi-task framework, named Seg4Reg+, which jointly optimizes the segmentation and regression networks. We thoroughly investigate both local and global consistency and knowledge transfer between each other. Specifically, we propose an attention regularization module leveraging class activation maps (CAMs) from image-segmentation pairs to discover additional supervision in the regression network, and the CAMs can serve as a region-of-interest **enhancement** gate to facilitate the segmentation task in turn. Meanwhile, we design a novel triangle consistency learning to train the two networks jointly for global optimization. The evaluations performed on the public AASCE Challenge dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and superior performance of our model to the state-of-the-art methods.  
### Training and Tuning Generative Neural Radiance Fields for Attribute-Conditional 3D-Aware Face Generation. (arXiv:2208.12550v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  3D-aware GANs based on generative neural radiance fields (G**NeRF**) have achieved impressive high-quality image generation, while preserving strong 3D consistency. The most notable achievements are made in the face generation domain. However, most of these models focus on improving view consistency but neglect a disentanglement aspect, thus these models cannot provide high-quality semantic/attribute control over generation. To this end, we introduce a conditional G**NeRF** model that uses specific attribute labels as input in order to improve the controllabilities and disentangling abilities of 3D-aware generative models. We utilize the pre-trained 3D-aware model as the basis and integrate a dual-branches attribute-editing module (DAEM), that utilize attribute labels to provide control over generation. Moreover, we propose a TRIOT (TRaining as Init, and Optimizing for Tuning) method to optimize the latent vector to improve the precision of the attribute-editing further. Extensive experiments on the widely used FFHQ show that our model yields high-quality editing with better view consistency while preserving the non-target regions. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangqianhui/TT-G**NeRF**.  
### PillarNet: Real-Time and High-Performance Pillar-based 3D Object Detection. (arXiv:2205.07403v5 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  **Real-time** and high-performance 3D object detection is of critical importance for autonomous driving. Recent top-performing 3D object detectors mainly rely on point-based or 3D voxel-based convolutions, which are both computationally inefficient for onboard deployment. In contrast, pillar-based methods use solely 2D convolutions, which consume less computation resources, but they lag far behind their voxel-based counterparts in detection accuracy. In this paper, by examining the primary performance gap between pillar- and voxel-based detectors, we develop a real-time and high-performance pillar-based detector, dubbed PillarNet.The proposed PillarNet consists of a powerful encoder network for effective pillar feature learning, a neck network for spatial-semantic feature fusion and the commonly used detect head. Using only 2D convolutions, PillarNet is flexible to an optional pillar size and compatible with classical 2D CNN backbones, such as VGGNet and ResNet. Additionally, PillarNet benefits from our designed orientation-decoupled IoU regression loss along with the IoU-aware prediction branch. Extensive experimental results on the large-scale nuScenes Dataset and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that the proposed PillarNet performs well over state-of-the-art 3D detectors in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/agent-sgs/PillarNet}.  
### **Restoration** of User Videos Shared on Social Media. (arXiv:2208.08597v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  User videos shared on social media platforms usually suffer from degradations caused by unknown proprietary processing procedures, which means that their visual quality is poorer than that of the originals. This paper presents a new general video **restoration** framework for the **restoration** of user videos shared on social media platforms. In contrast to most deep learning-based video **restoration** methods that perform end-to-end mapping, where feature extraction is mostly treated as a black box, in the sense that what role a feature plays is often unknown, our new method, termed Video restOration through adapTive dEgradation Sensing (VOTES), introduces the concept of a degradation feature map (DFM) to explicitly guide the video **restoration** process. Specifically, for each video frame, we first adaptively estimate its DFM to extract features representing the difficulty of restoring its different regions. We then feed the DFM to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to compute hierarchical degradation features to modulate an end-to-end video **restoration** backbone network, such that more attention is paid explicitly to potentially more difficult to restore areas, which in turn leads to enhanced **restoration** performance. We will explain the design rationale of the VOTES framework and present extensive experimental results to show that the new VOTES method outperforms various state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition, we contribute a large scale real-world database of user videos shared on different social media platforms. Codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/luohongming/VOTES.git

### VEViD: Vision **Enhancement** via Virtual diffraction and coherent Detection. (arXiv:2208.12366v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors : Callen MacPhee, Bahram Jalali

> ABSTRACT  :  The history of computing started with analog computers consisting of physical devices performing specialized functions such as predicting the trajectory of cannon balls. In modern times, this idea has been extended, for example, to ultrafast nonlinear optics serving as a surrogate analog computer to probe the behavior of complex phenomena such as rogue waves. Here we discuss a new paradigm where physical phenomena coded as an algorithm perform computational imaging tasks. Specifically, diffraction followed by coherent detection, not in its analog realization but when coded as an algorithm, becomes an image **enhancement** tool. Vision **Enhancement** via Virtual diffraction and coherent Detection (VEViD) introduced here reimagines a digital image as a spatially varying metaphoric light field and then subjects the field to the physical processes akin to diffraction and coherent detection. The term "Virtual" captures the deviation from the physical world. The light field is pixelated and the propagation imparts a phase with an arbitrary dependence on frequency which can be different from the quadratic behavior of physical diffraction. Temporal frequencies exist in three bands corresponding to the RGB color channels of a digital image. The phase of the output, not the intensity, represents the output image. VEViD is a high-performance **low-light**-level and color **enhancement** tool that emerges from this paradigm. The algorithm is interpretable and computationally efficient. We demonstrate image **enhancement** of 4k video at 200frames per second and show the utility of this physical algorithm in improving the accuracy of object detection by neural networks without having to retrain model for **low-light** conditions. The application of VEViD to color **enhancement** is also demonstrated.  
### A Topological Loss Function: Image Denoising on a **Low-Light** Dataset. (arXiv:2208.04573v3 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04573](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04573)
> ABSTRACT  :  Although image denoising algorithms have attracted significant research attention, surprisingly few have been proposed for, or evaluated on, noise from imagery acquired under real **low-light** conditions. Moreover, noise characteristics are often assumed to be spatially invariant, leading to edges and textures being distorted after denoising. Here, we introduce a novel topological loss function which is based on persistent homology. The method performs in the space of image patches, where topological invariants are calculated and represented in persistent diagrams. The loss function is a combination of $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ losses with the new persistence-based topological loss. We compare its performance across popular denoising architectures, training the networks on our new comprehensive dataset of natural images captured in **low-light** conditions -- BVI-LOWLIGHT. Analysis reveals that this approach outperforms existing methods, adapting well to complex structures and suppressing common artifacts.

### Decoding speech from non-invasive brain recordings. (arXiv:2208.12266v1 [eess.AS])
- Authors : Charlotte Caucheteux, my Rapin, Ori Kabeli, mi King
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12266](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12266)
> ABSTRACT  :  Decoding language from brain activity is a long-awaited goal in both healthcare and neuroscience. Major milestones have recently been reached thanks to intracranial devices: subject-specific pipelines trained on invasive brain responses to basic language tasks now start to efficiently decode interpretable features (e.g. letters, words, spectrograms). However, scaling this approach to natural speech and non-invasive brain recordings remains a major challenge. Here, we propose a single end-to-end architecture trained with contrastive learning across a large cohort of individuals to predict self-supervised representations of natural speech. We evaluate our model on four public datasets, encompassing 169 volunteers recorded with magneto- or electro-encephalography (M/EEG), while they listened to natural speech. The results show that our model can identify, from 3s of MEG signals, the corresponding speech segment with up to 72.5% top-10 accuracy out of 1,594 distinct segments (and 44% top-1 accuracy), and up to 19.1% out of 2,604 segments for EEG recordings -- hence allowing the decoding of phrases absent from the training set. Model comparison and ablation analyses show that these performances directly benefit from our original design choices, namely the use of (i) a contrastive objective, (ii) pretrained representations of speech and (iii) a common convolutional architecture simultaneously trained across several participants. Together, these results delineate a promising path to decode natural language processing in **real time** from non-invasive recordings of brain activity.

### Music Separation **Enhancement** with Generative Modeling. (arXiv:2208.12387v1 [cs.SD])

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12387](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12387)
> ABSTRACT  :  Despite phenomenal progress in recent years, state-of-the-art music separation systems produce source estimates with significant perceptual shortcomings, such as adding extraneous noise or removing harmonics. We propose a post-processing model (the Make it Sound Good (MSG) post-processor) to enhance the output of music source separation systems. We apply our post-processing model to state-of-the-art waveform-based and spectrogram-based music source separators, including a separator unseen by MSG during training. Our analysis of the errors produced by source separators shows that waveform models tend to introduce more high-frequency noise, while spectrogram models tend to lose transients and high frequency content. We introduce objective measures to quantify both kinds of errors and show MSG improves the source reconstruction of both kinds of errors. Crowdsourced subjective evaluations demonstrate that human listeners prefer source estimates of bass and drums that have been post-processed by MSG.  
### Deep learning-based fast time-resolved flame emission spectroscopy in high-pressure combustion environment. (arXiv:2208.12544v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  A novel deep learning strategy is developed for fast and accurate gas property measurements using flame emission spectroscopy (FES). Particularly, the short-gated fast FES is essential to resolve fast-evolving combustion behaviors. However, as the **exposure** time for capturing the flame emission spectrum gets shorter, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases, and characteristic spectral features indicating the gas properties become relatively weaker. Then, the property estimation based on the short-gated spectrum is difficult and inaccurate. Denoising convolutional neural networks (CNN) can enhance the SNR of the short-gated spectrum. A new CNN architecture including a reversible down- and up-sampling (DU) operator and a loss function based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) coefficients is proposed. For training and testing the CNN, flame chemiluminescence spectra were captured from a stable methane-air flat flame using a portable spectrometer (spectral range: 250-850 nm, resolution: 0.5 nm) with varied equivalence ratio (0.8-1.2), pressure (1-10 bar), and **exposure** time (0.05, 0.2, 0.4, and 2 s). The long **exposure** (2 s) spectra were used as the ground truth when training the denoising CNN. A kriging model with POD is trained by the long-gated spectra for calibration and then prediction of the gas properties taking the denoised short-gated spectrum as the input. The measurement or property prediction errors of pressure and equivalence ratio using the new technique were estimated to be 5.7% and 1.5% with 0.2 s **exposure**, which are exceptionally good and typically not achievable with such low SNR spectrum signals without a signal amplifier.  
### Spatial-Temporal Meta-path Guided Explainable Crime Prediction. (arXiv:2205.01901v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  **Exposure** to crime and violence can harm individuals' quality of life and the economic growth of communities. In light of the rapid development in machine learning, there is a rise in the need to explore automated solutions to prevent crimes. With the increasing availability of both fine-grained urban and public service data, there is a recent surge in fusing such cross-domain information to facilitate crime prediction. By capturing the information about social structure, environment, and crime trends, existing machine learning predictive models have explored the dynamic crime patterns from different views. However, these approaches mostly convert such multi-source knowledge into implicit and latent representations (e.g., learned embeddings of districts), making it still a challenge to investigate the impacts of explicit factors for the occurrences of crimes behind the scenes. In this paper, we present a Spatial-Temporal Metapath guided Explainable Crime prediction (STMEC) framework to capture dynamic patterns of crime behaviours and explicitly characterize how the environmental and social factors mutually interact to produce the forecasts. Extensive experiments show the superiority of STMEC compared with other advanced spatiotemporal models, especially in predicting felonies (e.g., robberies and assaults with dangerous weapons).
