### Two Decades of Colorization and Decolorization for Images and Videos. (arXiv:2204.13322v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Colorization is a computer-aided process, which aims to give color to a gray image or video. It can be used to enhance black-and-white images, including black-and-white photos, old-fashioned films, and scientific imaging results. On the contrary, decolorization is to convert a color image or video into a grayscale one. A grayscale image or video refers to an image or video with only brightness information without color information. It is the basis of some downstream image processing applications such as pattern recognition, image segmentation, and image **enhancement**. Different from image decolorization, video decolorization should not only consider the image contrast preservation in each video frame, but also respect the temporal and spatial consistency between video frames. Researchers were devoted to develop decolorization methods by balancing spatial-temporal consistency and algorithm efficiency. With the prevalance of the digital cameras and mobile phones, image and video colorization and decolorization have been paid more and more attention by researchers. This paper gives an overview of the progress of image and video colorization and decolorization methods in the last two decades.  
### Deep Generalized Unfolding Networks for Image **Restoration**. (arXiv:2204.13348v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved great success in image **restoration**. However, most DNN methods are designed as a black box, lacking transparency and interpretability. Although some methods are proposed to combine traditional optimization algorithms with DNN, they usually demand pre-defined degradation processes or handcrafted assumptions, making it difficult to deal with complex and real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a Deep Generalized Unfolding Network (DGUNet) for image **restoration**. Concretely, without loss of interpretability, we integrate a gradient estimation strategy into the gradient descent step of the Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, driving it to deal with complex and real-world image degradation. In addition, we design inter-stage information pathways across proximal mapping in different PGD iterations to rectify the intrinsic information loss in most deep unfolding networks (DUN) through a multi-scale and spatial-adaptive way. By integrating the flexible gradient descent and informative proximal mapping, we unfold the iterative PGD algorithm into a trainable DNN. Extensive experiments on various image **restoration** tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of state-of-the-art performance, interpretability, and generalizability.

> ABSTRACT  :  We propose a novel framework for 3D-aware object manipulation, called Auto-Encoding Neural Radiance Fields (AE-**NeRF**). Our model, which is formulated in an auto-encoder architecture, extracts disentangled 3D attributes such as 3D shape, appearance, and camera pose from an image, and a high-quality image is rendered from the attributes through disentangled generative Neural Radiance Fields (**NeRF**). To improve the disentanglement ability, we present two losses, global-local attribute consistency loss defined between input and output, and swapped-attribute classification loss. Since training such auto-encoding networks from scratch without ground-truth shape and appearance information is non-trivial, we present a stage-wise training scheme, which dramatically helps to boost the performance. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model over the latest methods and provide extensive ablation studies.

> ABSTRACT  :  Unsupervised generation of high-quality multi-view-consistent images and 3D shapes using only collections of single-view 2D photographs has been a long-standing challenge. Existing 3D GANs are either compute-intensive or make approximations that are not 3D-consistent; the former limits quality and resolution of the generated images and the latter adversely affects multi-view consistency and shape quality. In this work, we improve the computational efficiency and image quality of 3D GANs without overly relying on these approximations. We introduce an expressive hybrid explicit-implicit network architecture that, together with other design choices, synthesizes not only high-resolution multi-view-consistent images in **real time** but also produces high-quality 3D geometry. By decoupling feature generation and neural rendering, our framework is able to leverage state-of-the-art 2D CNN generators, such as StyleGAN2, and inherit their efficiency and expressiveness. We demonstrate state-of-the-art 3D-aware synthesis with FFHQ and AFHQ Cats, among other experiments.  
### Multi-Bracket **High Dynamic Range** Imaging with Event Cameras. (arXiv:2203.06622v3 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06622](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06622)
> ABSTRACT  :  Modern **high dynamic range** (**HDR**) imaging pipelines align and fuse multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images captured at different **exposure** times. While these methods work well in static scenes, dynamic scenes remain a challenge since the LDR images still suffer from saturation and noise. In such scenarios, event cameras would be a valid complement, thanks to their higher temporal resolution and dynamic range. In this paper, we propose the first multi-bracket **HDR** pipeline combining a standard camera with an event camera. Our results show better overall robustness when using events, with improvements in PSNR by up to 5dB on synthetic data and up to 0.7dB on real-world data. We also introduce a new dataset containing bracketed LDR images with aligned events and **HDR** ground truth.

### Music **Enhancement** via Image Translation and Vocoding. (arXiv:2204.13289v1 [cs.SD])
- Authors : Nikhil Kandpal, Oriol Nieto, Zeyu Jin

> ABSTRACT  :  Consumer-grade music recordings such as those captured by mobile devices typically contain distortions in the form of background noise, reverb, and microphone-induced EQ. This paper presents a deep learning approach to enhance low-quality music recordings by combining (i) an image-to-image translation model for manipulating audio in its mel-spectrogram representation and (ii) a music vocoding model for mapping synthetically generated mel-spectrograms to perceptually realistic waveforms. We find that this approach to music **enhancement** outperforms baselines which use classical methods for mel-spectrogram inversion and an end-to-end approach directly mapping noisy waveforms to clean waveforms. Additionally, in evaluating the proposed method with a listening test, we analyze the reliability of common audio **enhancement** evaluation metrics when used in the music domain.  
### Continual Learning for Peer-to-Peer Federated Learning: A Study on Automated Brain Metastasis Identification. (arXiv:2204.13591v1 [cs.LG])

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13591](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13591)
> ABSTRACT  :  Due to data privacy constraints, data sharing among multiple centers is restricted. Continual learning, as one approach to peer-to-peer federated learning, can promote multicenter collaboration on deep learning algorithm development by sharing intermediate models instead of training data. This work aims to investigate the feasibility of continual learning for multicenter collaboration on an exemplary application of brain metastasis identification using DeepMedic. 920 T1 MRI contrast enhanced volumes are split to simulate multicenter collaboration scenarios. A continual learning algorithm, synaptic intelligence (SI), is applied to preserve important model weights for training one center after another. In a **bilateral** collaboration scenario, continual learning with SI achieves a sensitivity of 0.917, and naive continual learning without SI achieves a sensitivity of 0.906, while two models trained on internal data solely without continual learning achieve sensitivity of 0.853 and 0.831 only. In a seven-center multilateral collaboration scenario, the models trained on internal datasets (100 volumes each center) without continual learning obtain a mean sensitivity value of 0.725. With single-visit continual learning (i.e., the shared model visits each center only once during training), the sensitivity is improved to 0.788 and 0.849 without SI and with SI, respectively. With iterative continual learning (i.e., the shared model revisits each center multiple times during training), the sensitivity is further improved to 0.914, which is identical to the sensitivity using mixed data for training. Our experiments demonstrate that continual learning can improve brain metastasis identification performance for centers with limited data. This study demonstrates the feasibility of applying continual learning for peer-to-peer federated learning in multicenter collaboration.  
### **Real-time** Outdoor Localization Using Radio Maps: A Deep Learning Approach. (arXiv:2106.12556v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  This paper deals with the problem of localization in a cellular network in a dense urban scenario. Global Navigation Satellite Systems typically perform poorly in urban environments, where the likelihood of line-of-sight conditions between the devices and the satellites is low, and thus alternative localization methods are required for good accuracy. We present LocUNet: A fully convolutional, end-to-end trained neural network for the localization task, which merely depends on the received signal strengths (RSS) from Base Stations (BSs).In a wireless network, user devices scan the base station beacon slots and identify the few strongest base station signals for handover and user-base station association purposes. In the proposed method, the user to be localized simply reports such received signal strengths to a central processing unit, which may be located in the cloud. Alternatively, the localization can be performed locally at the user. Using the pathloss radio map estimations and the RSS measurements, LocUNet can localize users with state-of-the-art accuracy and enjoys high robustness to inaccuracies in the estimations of the radio maps. The proposed method does not require pre-sampling of the environment; and is suitable for real-time applications, thanks to the RadioUNet, a neural network-based radio map estimator. Moreover, two novel datasets that allow for numerical evaluations of RSS and ToA methods in realistic urban environments are presented and set publicly available for the use of research community. By using these datasets, we also provided a fair comparison of state-of-the-art RSS and ToA-based methods in the dense urban scenario, LocUNet outperforming all the compared methods.

### DIANES: A DEI Audit Toolkit for News Sources. (arXiv:2203.11383v2 [cs.IR] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Professional news media organizations have always touted the importance that they give to multiple perspectives. However, in practice the traditional approach to all-sides has favored people in the dominant culture. Hence it has come under ethical critique under the new norms of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). When DEI is applied to journalism, it goes beyond conventional notions of impartiality and bias and instead democratizes the journalistic practice of sourcing -- who is quoted or interviewed, who is not, how often, from which demographic group, gender, and so forth. There is currently no real-time or on-demand tool in the hands of reporters to analyze the persons they quote. In this paper, we present DIANES, a DEI Audit Toolkit for News Sources. It consists of a natural language processing pipeline on the backend to extract quotes, speakers, titles, and organizations from news articles in **real time**. On the frontend, DIANES offers the WordPress plugins, a Web monitor, and a DEI annotation API service, to help news media monitor their own quoting patterns and push themselves towards DEI norms.  
### Can deep learning match the efficiency of human visual long-term memory in storing object details?. (arXiv:2204.13061v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)
- Authors : Emin Orhan

> ABSTRACT  :  Humans have a remarkably large capacity to store detailed visual information in long-term memory even after a single **exposure**, as demonstrated by classic experiments in psychology. For example, Standing (1973) showed that humans could recognize with high accuracy thousands of pictures that they had seen only once a few days prior to a recognition test. In deep learning, the primary mode of incorporating new information into a model is through gradient descent in the model's parameter space. This paper asks whether deep learning via gradient descent can match the efficiency of human visual long-term memory to incorporate new information in a rigorous, head-to-head, quantitative comparison. We answer this in the negative: even in the best case, models learning via gradient descent appear to require approximately 10 **exposure**s to the same visual materials in order to reach a recognition memory performance humans achieve after only a single **exposure**. Prior knowledge induced via pretraining and bigger model sizes improve performance, but these improvements are not very visible after a single **exposure** (it takes a few **exposure**s for the improvements to become apparent), suggesting that simply scaling up the pretraining data size or model size might not be enough for the model to reach human-level memory efficiency.

### Enhance Ambiguous Community Structure via Multi-strategy Community Related Link Prediction Method with Evolutionary Process. (arXiv:2204.13301v1 [cs.SI])
- Authors : Qiming Yang, Wei Wei, Ruizhi Zhang, Bowen Pang, Xiangnan Feng
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13301](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13301)
> ABSTRACT  :  Most real-world networks suffer from incompleteness or incorrectness, which is an inherent attribute to real-world datasets. As a consequence, those downstream machine learning tasks in complex network like community detection methods may yield less satisfactory results, i.e., a proper preprocessing measure is required here. To address this issue, in this paper, we design a new community attribute based link prediction strategy HAP and propose a two-step community **enhancement** algorithm with automatic evolution process based on HAP. This paper aims at providing a community **enhancement** measure through adding links to clarify ambiguous community structures. The HAP method takes the neighbourhood uncertainty and Shannon entropy to identify boundary nodes, and establishes links by considering the nodes' community attributes and community size at the same time. The experimental results on twelve real-world datasets with ground truth community indicate that the proposed link prediction method outperforms other baseline methods and the **enhancement** of community follows the expected evolution process.
