### Domain Gap Estimation for Source Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Many Classifiers. (arXiv:2207.05785v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Ziyang Zong, Jun He, **Lei Zhang**, Hai Huan

> ABSTRACT  :  In theory, the success of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) largely relies on domain gap estimation. However, for source free UDA, the source domain data can not be accessed during adaptation, which poses great challenge of measuring the domain gap. In this paper, we propose to use many classifiers to learn the source domain decision boundaries, which provides a tighter upper bound of the domain gap, even if both of the domain data can not be simultaneously accessed. The source model is trained to push away each pair of classifiers whilst ensuring the correctness of the decision boundaries. In this sense, our many classifiers model separates the source different categories as far as possible which induces the maximum disagreement of many classifiers in the target domain, thus the transferable source domain knowledge is maximized. For adaptation, the source model is adapted to maximize the agreement among pairs of the classifiers. Thus the target features are pushed away from the decision boundaries. Experiments on several datasets of UDA show that our approach achieves state of the art performance among source free UDA approaches and can even compete to source available UDA methods.  
### Visual Context-driven Audio Feature **Enhancement** for Robust End-to-End Audio-Visual Speech Recognition. (arXiv:2207.06020v1 [cs.SD])

> ABSTRACT  :  This paper focuses on designing a noise-robust end-to-end Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) system. To this end, we propose Visual Context-driven Audio Feature **Enhancement** module (V-CAFE) to enhance the input noisy audio speech with a help of audio-visual correspondence. The proposed V-CAFE is designed to capture the transition of lip movements, namely visual context and to generate a noise reduction mask by considering the obtained visual context. Through context-dependent modeling, the ambiguity in viseme-to-phoneme mapping can be refined for mask generation. The noisy representations are masked out with the noise reduction mask resulting in enhanced audio features. The enhanced audio features are fused with the visual features and taken to an encoder-decoder model composed of Conformer and Transformer for speech recognition. We show the proposed end-to-end AVSR with the V-CAFE can further improve the noise-robustness of AVSR. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated in noisy speech recognition and overlapped speech recognition experiments using the two largest audio-visual datasets, LRS2 and LRS3.  
### MultiStream: A Simple and Fast Multiple Cameras Visual Monitor and Directly Streaming. (arXiv:2207.06078v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Jinwei Lin

> ABSTRACT  :  Monitoring and streaming is one of the most important applications for the **real time** cameras. The research of this has provided a novel design idea that uses the FFmpeg and Tkinter, combining with the libraries: OpenCV and PIL to develop a simple but fast streaming toolkit MultiSteam that can achieve the function of visible monitoring streaming for multiple simultaneously. MultiStream is able to automatically arrange the layout of the displays of multiple camera windows and intelligently analyze the input streaming URL to select the correct corresponding streaming communication protocol. Multiple cameras can be streamed with different communication protocols or the same protocol. Besides, the paper has tested the different streaming speeds for different protocols in camera streaming. MultiStream is able to gain the information of media equipment on the computer. The configuration information for media-id selection and multiple cameras streaming can be saved as json files.  
### Learnability **Enhancement** for **Low-light** Raw Denoising: Where Paired Real Data Meets Noise Modeling. (arXiv:2207.06103v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Hansen Feng, Lizhi Wang, Yuzhi Wang, Hua Huang
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06103](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06103)
> ABSTRACT  :  **Low-light** raw denoising is an important and valuable task in computational photography where learning-based methods trained with paired real data are mainstream. However, the limited data volume and complicated noise distribution have constituted a learnability bottleneck for paired real data, which limits the denoising performance of learning-based methods. To address this issue, we present a learnability **enhancement** strategy to reform paired real data according to noise modeling. Our strategy consists of two efficient techniques: shot noise augmentation (SNA) and **dark** shading correction (DSC). Through noise model decoupling, SNA improves the precision of data mapping by increasing the data volume and DSC reduces the complexity of data mapping by reducing the noise complexity. Extensive results on the public datasets and real imaging scenarios collectively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.  
### ACLNet: An Attention and Clustering-based Cloud Segmentation Network. (arXiv:2207.06277v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Dhruv Makwana, Subhrajit Nag, Onkar Susladkar, Gayatri Deshmukh, Sai Chandra, Sparsh Mittal, Krishna Mohan
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06277](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06277)
> ABSTRACT  :  We propose a novel deep learning model named ACLNet, for cloud segmentation from ground images. ACLNet uses both deep neural network and machine learning (ML) algorithm to extract complementary features. Specifically, it uses EfficientNet-B0 as the backbone, "`a trous spatial pyramid pooling" (ASPP) to learn at multiple receptive fields, and "global attention module" (GAM) to extract finegrained details from the image. ACLNet also uses k-means clustering to extract cloud boundaries more precisely. ACLNet is effective for both daytime and **night**time images. It provides lower error rate, higher recall and higher F1-score than state-of-art cloud segmentation models. The source-code of ACLNet is available here: https://github.com/ckmvigil/ACLNet.  
### Implicit Neural Representations for Generative Modeling of Living Cell Shapes. (arXiv:2207.06283v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : David Wiesner, Julian Suk, Sven Dummer, David Svoboda
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06283](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06283)
> ABSTRACT  :  Methods allowing the synthesis of realistic cell shapes could help generate training data sets to improve cell tracking and segmentation in biomedical images. Deep generative models for cell shape synthesis require a light-weight and flexible representation of the cell shape. However, commonly used voxel-based representations are unsuitable for high-resolution shape synthesis, and polygon meshes have limitations when modeling topology changes such as cell growth or mitosis. In this work, we propose to use level sets of signed distance functions (SDFs) to represent cell shapes. We optimize a neural network as an **implicit neural representation** of the SDF value at any point in a 3D+time domain. The model is conditioned on a latent code, thus allowing the synthesis of new and unseen shape sequences. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on C. elegans cells that grow and divide, and lung cancer cells with growing complex filopodial protrusions. Our results show that shape descriptors of synthetic cells resemble those of real cells, and that our model is able to generate topologically plausible sequences of complex cell shapes in 3D+time.  
### 6D Camera Relocalization in Visually Ambiguous Extreme Environments. (arXiv:2207.06333v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Yang Zheng, Tolga Birdal, Fei Xia, Yanchao Yang, Yueqi Duan
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06333](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06333)
> ABSTRACT  :  We propose a novel method to reliably estimate the pose of a camera given a sequence of images acquired in extreme environments such as deep seas or extraterrestrial terrains. Data acquired under these challenging conditions are corrupted by textureless surfaces, image degradation, and presence of repetitive and highly ambiguous structures. When naively deployed, the state-of-the-art methods can fail in those scenarios as confirmed by our empirical analysis. In this paper, we attempt to make camera relocalization work in these extreme situations. To this end, we propose: (i) a hierarchical localization system, where we leverage temporal information and (ii) a novel environment-aware image **enhancement** method to boost the robustness and accuracy. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in favor of our method under two extreme settings: localizing an autonomous underwater vehicle and localizing a planetary rover in a Mars-like desert. In addition, our method achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods on the indoor benchmark (7-Scenes dataset) using only 20% training data.  
### Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation for Video Frame Interpolation. (arXiv:2011.06294v12 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06294](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06294)
> ABSTRACT  :  **Real-time** video frame interpolation (VFI) is very useful in video processing, media players, and display devices. We propose RIFE, a **Real-time** Intermediate Flow Estimation algorithm for VFI. To realize a high-quality flow-based VFI method, RIFE uses a neural network named IFNet that can estimate the intermediate flows end-to-end with much faster speed. A privileged distillation scheme is designed for stable IFNet training and improve the overall performance. RIFE does not rely on pre-trained optical flow models and can support arbitrary-timestep frame interpolation with the temporal encoding input. Experiments demonstrate that RIFE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks. Compared with the popular SuperSlomo and DAIN methods, RIFE is 4--27 times faster and produces better results. Furthermore, RIFE can be extended to wider applications thanks to temporal encoding. The code is available at https://github.com/megvii-research/ECCV2022-RIFE.  
### Patient-specific modelling, simulation and **real time** processing for respiratory diseases. (arXiv:2207.01082v3 [eess.IV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Stavros Nousias

> ABSTRACT  :  Asthma is a common chronic disease of the respiratory system causing significant disability and societal burden. It affects over 500 million people worldwide and generates costs exceeding $USD 56 billion in 2011 in the United States. Managing asthma involves controlling symptoms, preventing exacerbations, and maintaining lung function. Improving asthma control affects the daily life of patients and is associated with a reduced risk of exacerbations and lung function impairment, reduces the cost of asthma care and indirect costs associated with reduced productivity. Understanding the complex dynamics of the pulmonary system and the lung's response to disease, injury, and treatment is fundamental to the advancement of Asthma treatment. Computational models of the respiratory system seek to provide a theoretical framework to understand the interaction between structure and function. Their application can improve pulmonary medicine by a patient-specific approach to medicinal methodologies optimizing the delivery given the personalized geometry and personalized ventilation patterns while introducing a patient-specific technique that maximizes drug delivery. A three-fold objective addressed within this dissertation becomes prominent at this point. The first part refers to the comprehension of pulmonary pathophysiology and the mechanics of Asthma and subsequently of constrictive pulmonary conditions in general. The second part refers to the design and implementation of tools that facilitate personalized medicine to improve delivery and effectiveness. Finally, the third part refers to the self-management of the condition, meaning that medical personnel and patients have access to tools and methods that allow the first party to easily track the course of the condition and the second party, i.e. the patient to easily self-manage it alleviating the significant burden from the health system.  
### Fast Vehicle Detection and Tracking on Fisheye Traffic Monitoring Video using CNN and Bounding Box Propagation. (arXiv:2207.01183v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01183](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01183)
> ABSTRACT  :  We design a fast car detection and tracking algorithm for traffic monitoring fisheye video mounted on crossroads. We use ICIP 2020 VIP Cup dataset and adopt YOLOv5 as the object detection base model. The **night**time video of this dataset is very challenging, and the detection accuracy (AP50) of the base model is about 54%. We design a reliable car detection and tracking algorithm based on the concept of bounding box propagation among frames, which provides 17.9 percentage points (pp) and 6.2 pp. accuracy improvement over the base model for the **night**time and daytime videos, respectively. To speed up, the grayscale frame difference is used for the intermediate frames in a segment, which can double the processing speed.

### Tilt-then-Blur or Blur-then-Tilt? Clarifying the Atmospheric Turbulence Model. (arXiv:2207.06377v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors :

> ABSTRACT  :  Imaging at a long distance often requires advanced image **restoration** algorithms to compensate for the distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence. However, unlike many standard **restoration** problems such as deconvolution, the forward image formation model of the atmospheric turbulence does not have a simple expression. Thanks to the Zernike representation of the phase, one can show that the forward model is a combination of tilt (pixel shifting due to the linear phase terms) and blur (image smoothing due to the high order aberrations).    Confusions then arise between the ordering of the two operators. Should the model be tilt-then-blur, or blur-then-tilt? Some papers in the literature say that the model is tilt-then-blur, whereas more papers say that it is blur-then-tilt. This paper clarifies the differences between the two and discusses why the tilt-then-blur is the correct model. Recommendations are given to the research community.

### Semi-unsupervised Learning for Time Series Classification. (arXiv:2207.03119v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)
- Authors : Padraig Davidson, Michael Steininger, Anna Krause, Andreas Hotho
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03119](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03119)
> ABSTRACT  :  Time series are ubiquitous and therefore inherently hard to analyze and ultimately to label or cluster. With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its smart devices, data is collected in large amounts any given second. The collected data is rich in information, as one can detect accidents (e.g. cars) in **real time**, or assess injury/sickness over a given time span (e.g. health devices). Due to its chaotic nature and massive amounts of datapoints, timeseries are hard to label manually. Furthermore new classes within the data could emerge over time (contrary to e.g. handwritten digits), which would require relabeling the data. In this paper we present SuSL4TS, a deep generative Gaussian mixture model for semi-unsupervised learning, to classify time series data. With our approach we can alleviate manual labeling steps, since we can detect sparsely labeled classes (semi-supervised) and identify emerging classes hidden in the data (unsupervised). We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with established time series classification datasets from different domains.
