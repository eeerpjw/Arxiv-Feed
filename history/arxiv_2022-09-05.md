> ABSTRACT  :  Several papers have rightly included minority groups in artificial intelligence (AI) training data to improve test inference for minority groups and/or society-at-large. A society-at-large consists of both minority and majority stakeholders. A common misconception is that minority inclusion does not increase performance for majority groups alone. In this paper, we make the surprising finding that including minority samples can improve test error for the majority group. In other words, minority group inclusion leads to majority group **enhancement**s (MIME) in performance. A theoretical existence proof of the MIME effect is presented and found to be consistent with experimental results on six different datasets. Project webpage: https://visual.ee.ucla.edu/mime.htm/

> ABSTRACT  :  LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking is a challenging issue in robotics and autonomous driving. Currently, existing approaches usually suffer from the problem that objects at long distance often have very sparse or partially-occluded point clouds, which makes the features extracted by the model ambiguous. Ambiguous features will make it hard to locate the target object and finally lead to bad tracking results. To solve this problem, we utilize the powerful Transformer architecture and propose a Point-Track-Transformer (PTT) module for point cloud-based 3D single object tracking task. Specifically, PTT module generates fine-tuned attention features by computing attention weights, which guides the tracker focusing on the important features of the target and improves the tracking ability in complex scenarios. To evaluate our PTT module, we embed PTT into the dominant method and construct a novel 3D SOT tracker named PTT-Net. In PTT-Net, we embed PTT into the voting stage and proposal generation stage, respectively. PTT module in the voting stage could model the interactions among point patches, which learns context-dependent features. Meanwhile, PTT module in the proposal generation stage could capture the contextual information between object and background. We evaluate our PTT-Net on KITTI and NuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PTT module and the superiority of PTT-Net, which surpasses the baseline by a noticeable margin, ~10% in the Car category. Meanwhile, our method also has a significant performance improvement in sparse scenarios. In general, the combination of transformer and tracking pipeline enables our PTT-Net to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both two datasets. Additionally, PTT-Net could run in real-time at 40FPS on NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU. Our code is open-sourced for the research community at https://github.com/shanjiayao/PTT.

> ABSTRACT  :  Image smoothing is a fundamental low-level vision task that aims to preserve salient structures of an image while removing insignificant details. Deep learning has been explored in image smoothing to deal with the complex entanglement of semantic structures and trivial details. However, current methods neglect two important facts in smoothing: 1) naive pixel-level regression supervised by the limited number of high-quality smoothing ground-truth could lead to domain shift and cause generalization problems towards real-world images; 2) texture appearance is closely related to object semantics, so that image smoothing requires awareness of semantic difference to apply adaptive smoothing strengths. To address these issues, we propose a novel Contrastive Semantic-Guided Image Smoothing Network (CSGIS-Net) that combines both contrastive prior and semantic prior to facilitate robust image smoothing. The supervision signal is augmented by leveraging undesired smoothing effects as negative teachers, and by incorporating segmentation tasks to encourage semantic distinctiveness. To realize the proposed network, we also enrich the original VOC dataset with texture **enhancement** and smoothing labels, namely VOC-smooth, which first bridges image smoothing and semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSGIS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/wangjie6866/CSGIS-Net.  
### On Quantizing Implicit Neural Representations. (arXiv:2209.01019v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Cameron Gordon, Fang Chng, Lachlan MacDonald, Simon Lucey

> ABSTRACT  :  The role of quantization within implicit/coordinate neural networks is still not fully understood. We note that using a canonical fixed quantization scheme during training produces poor performance at low-rates due to the network weight distributions changing over the course of training. In this work, we show that a non-uniform quantization of neural weights can lead to significant improvements. Specifically, we demonstrate that a clustered quantization enables improved reconstruction. Finally, by characterising a trade-off between quantization and network capacity, we demonstrate that it is possible (while memory inefficient) to reconstruct signals using binary neural networks. We demonstrate our findings experimentally on 2D image reconstruction and 3D radiance fields; and show that simple quantization methods and architecture search can achieve compression of **NeRF** to less than 16kb with minimal loss in performance (323x smaller than the original **NeRF**).

> ABSTRACT  :  Tumor volume and changes in tumor characteristics over time are important biomarkers for cancer therapy. In this context, FDG-PET/CT scans are routinely used for staging and re-staging of cancer, as the radiolabeled fluorodeoxyglucose is taken up in regions of high metabolism. Unfortunately, these regions with high metabolism are not specific to tumors and can also represent physiological uptake by normal functioning organs, inflammation, or infection, making detailed and reliable tumor segmentation in these scans a demanding task. This gap in research is addressed by the AutoPET challenge, which provides a public data set with FDG-PET/CT scans from 900 patients to encourage further improvement in this field. Our contribution to this challenge is an ensemble of two state-of-the-art segmentation models, the nn-Unet and the **Swin** UNETR, augmented by a maximum intensity projection classifier that acts like a gating mechanism. If it predicts the existence of lesions, both segmentations are combined by a late fusion approach. Our solution achieves a Dice score of 72.12\% on patients diagnosed with lung cancer, melanoma, and lymphoma in our cross-validation. Code: https://github.com/heiligerl/autopet_submission

> ABSTRACT  :  Recent advances in neural radiance fields (**NeRF**s) achieve state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and facilitate dense estimation of scene properties. However, **NeRF**s often fail for large, unbounded scenes that are captured under very sparse views with the scene content concentrated far away from the camera, as is typical for field robotics applications. In particular, **NeRF**-style algorithms perform poorly: (1) when there are insufficient views with little pose diversity, (2) when scenes contain saturation and shadows, and (3) when finely sampling large unbounded scenes with fine structures becomes computationally intensive.    This paper proposes CLONeR, which significantly improves upon **NeRF** by allowing it to model large outdoor driving scenes that are observed from sparse input sensor views. This is achieved by decoupling occupancy and color learning within the **NeRF** framework into separate Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained using LiDAR and camera data, respectively. In addition, this paper proposes a novel method to build differentiable 3D Occupancy Grid Maps (OGM) alongside the **NeRF** model, and leverage this occupancy grid for improved sampling of points along a ray for volumetric rendering in metric space.    Through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on scenes from the KITTI dataset, this paper demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art **NeRF** models on both novel view synthesis and dense depth prediction tasks when trained on sparse input data.  
### Progressive Joint **Low-light** **Enhancement** and Noise Removal for Raw Images. (arXiv:2106.14844v4 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  **Low-light** imaging on mobile devices is typically challenging due to insufficient incident light coming through the relatively small aperture, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the previous works on **low-light** image processing focus either only on a single task such as illumination adjustment, color **enhancement**, or noise removal; or on a joint illumination adjustment and denoising task that heavily relies on short-long **exposure** image pairs collected from specific camera models, and thus these approaches are less practical and generalizable in real-world settings where camera-specific joint **enhancement** and **restoration** is required. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a **low-light** image processing framework that performs joint illumination adjustment, color **enhancement**, and denoising. Considering the difficulty in model-specific data collection and the ultra-high definition of the captured images, we design two branches: a coefficient estimation branch as well as a joint **enhancement** and denoising branch. The coefficient estimation branch works in a low-resolution space and predicts the coefficients for **enhancement** via **bilateral** learning, whereas the joint **enhancement** and denoising branch works in a full-resolution space and progressively performs joint **enhancement** and denoising. In contrast to existing methods, our framework does not need to recollect massive data when being adapted to another camera model, which significantly reduces the efforts required to fine-tune our approach for practical usage. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate its great potential in real-world **low-light** imaging applications when compared with current state-of-the-art methods.  
### Pixel-wise Energy-biased Abstention Learning for Anomaly Segmentation on Complex Urban Driving Scenes. (arXiv:2111.12264v5 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  State-of-the-art (SOTA) anomaly segmentation approaches on complex urban driving scenes explore pixel-wise classification uncertainty learned from outlier **exposure**, or external reconstruction models. However, previous uncertainty approaches that directly associate high uncertainty to anomaly may sometimes lead to incorrect anomaly predictions, and external reconstruction models tend to be too inefficient for real-time self-driving embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly segmentation method, named pixel-wise energy-biased abstention learning (PEBAL), that explores pixel-wise abstention learning (AL) with a model that learns an adaptive pixel-level anomaly class, and an energy-based model (EBM) that learns inlier pixel distribution. More specifically, PEBAL is based on a non-trivial joint training of EBM and AL, where EBM is trained to output high-energy for anomaly pixels (from outlier **exposure**) and AL is trained such that these high-energy pixels receive adaptive low penalty for being included to the anomaly class. We extensively evaluate PEBAL against the SOTA and show that it achieves the best performance across four benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/tianyu0207/PEBAL.  
### E2FIF: Push the limit of Binarized Deep Imagery Super-resolution using End-to-end Full-precision Information Flow. (arXiv:2207.06893v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Binary neural network (BNN) provides a promising solution to deploy parameter-intensive deep single image super-resolution (SISR) models onto real devices with limited storage and computational resources. To achieve comparable performance with the full-precision counterpart, most existing BNNs for SISR mainly focus on compensating the information loss incurred by binarizing weights and activations in the network through better approximations to the binarized convolution. In this study, we revisit the difference between BNNs and their full-precision counterparts and argue that the key for good generalization performance of BNNs lies on preserving a complete full-precision information flow as well as an accurate gradient flow passing through each binarized convolution layer. Inspired by this, we propose to introduce a full-precision skip connection or its variant over each binarized convolution layer across the entire network, which can increase the forward expressive capability and the accuracy of back-propagated gradient, thus enhancing the generalization performance. More importantly, such a scheme is applicable to any existing BNN backbones for SISR without introducing any additional computation cost. To testify its efficacy, we evaluate it using four different backbones for SISR on four benchmark datasets and report obviously superior performance over existing BNNs and even some 4-bit competitors.

### **Dark** soliton detection using persistent homology. (arXiv:2107.14594v2 [physics.atom-ph] UPDATED)
- Authors : Daniel Leykam, Irving Rondon
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14594](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14594)
> ABSTRACT  :  Classifying images often requires manual identification of qualitative features. Machine learning approaches including convolutional neural networks can achieve accuracy comparable to human classifiers, but require extensive data and computational resources to train. We show how a topological data analysis technique, persistent homology, can be used to rapidly and reliably identify qualitative features in experimental image data. The identified features can be used as inputs to simple supervised machine learning models such as logistic regression models, which are easier to train. As an example we consider the identification of **dark** solitons using a dataset of 6257 labelled atomic Bose-Einstein condensate density images.

### MIME: Minority Inclusion for Majority Group **Enhancement** of AI Performance. (arXiv:2209.00746v1 [cs.LG])

### Diffusion Models: A Comprehensive Survey of Methods and Applications. (arXiv:2209.00796v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Ling Yang, Zhilong Zhang, Shenda Hong

> ABSTRACT  :  Diffusion models are a class of deep generative models that have shown impressive results on various tasks with dense theoretical founding. Although diffusion models have achieved impressive quality and diversity of sample synthesis than other state-of-the-art models, they still suffer from costly sampling procedure and sub-optimal likelihood estimation. Recent studies have shown great enthusiasm on improving the performance of diffusion model. In this article, we present a first comprehensive review of existing variants of the diffusion models. Specifically, we provide a first taxonomy of diffusion models and categorize them variants to three types, namely sampling-acceleration **enhancement**, likelihood-maximization **enhancement** and data-generalization **enhancement**. We also introduce in detail other five generative models (i.e., variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, normalizing flow, autoregressive models, and energy-based models), and clarify the connections between diffusion models and these generative models. Then we make a thorough investigation into the applications of diffusion models, including computer vision, natural language processing, waveform signal processing, multi-modal modeling, molecular graph generation, time series modeling, and adversarial purification. Furthermore, we propose new perspectives pertaining to the development of this generative model.  
### Ranking-Based Physics-Informed Line Failure Detection in Power Grids. (arXiv:2209.01021v1 [eess.SP])

> ABSTRACT  :  Climate change increases the number of extreme weather events (wind and snowstorms, heavy rains, wildfires) that compromise power system reliability and lead to multiple equipment failures. **Real-time** and accurate detecting of potential line failures is the first step to mitigating the extreme weather impact and activating emergency controls. Power balance equations nonlinearity, increased uncertainty in generation during extreme events, and lack of grid observability compromise the efficiency of traditional data-driven failure detection methods. At the same time, modern problem-oblivious machine learning methods based on neural networks require a large amount of data to detect an accident, especially in a time-changing environment. This paper proposes a Physics-InformEd Line failure Detector (FIELD) that leverages grid topology information to reduce sample and time complexities and improve localization accuracy. Finally, we illustrate the superior empirical performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods over various test cases.  
### Semi-Centralised Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Policy-Embedded Training. (arXiv:2209.01054v1 [cs.MA])

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01054](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01054)
> ABSTRACT  :  Centralised training (CT) is the basis for many popular multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods because it allows agents to quickly learn high-performing policies. However, CT relies on agents learning from one-off observations of other agents' actions at a given state. Because MARL agents explore and update their policies during training, these observations often provide poor predictions about other agents' behaviour and the expected return for a given action. CT methods therefore suffer from high variance and error-prone estimates, harming learning. CT methods also suffer from explosive growth in complexity due to the reliance on global observations, unless strong factorisation restrictions are imposed (e.g., monotonic reward functions for QMIX). We address these challenges with a new semi-centralised MARL framework that performs policy-embedded training and decentralised execution. Our method, policy embedded reinforcement learning algorithm (PERLA), is an **enhancement** tool for Actor-Critic MARL algorithms that leverages a novel parameter sharing protocol and policy embedding method to maintain estimates that account for other agents' behaviour. Our theory proves PERLA dramatically reduces the variance in value estimates. Unlike various CT methods, PERLA, which seamlessly adopts MARL algorithms, scales easily with the number of agents without the need for restrictive factorisation assumptions. We demonstrate PERLA's superior empirical performance and efficient scaling in benchmark environments including StarCraft Micromanagement II and Multi-agent Mujoco
