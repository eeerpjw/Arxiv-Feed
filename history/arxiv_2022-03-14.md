> ABSTRACT  :  Glioblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults. Approximately 200000 people die each year from Glioblastoma in the world. Glioblastoma patients have a median survival of 12 months with optimal therapy and about 4 months without treatment. Glioblastomas appear as heterogeneous necrotic masses with irregular peripheral **enhancement**, surrounded by vasogenic edema. The current standard of care includes surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which require accurate segmentation of brain tumor subregions. For effective treatment planning, it is vital to identify the methylation status of the promoter of Methylguanine Methyltransferase (MGMT), a positive prognostic factor for chemotherapy. However, current methods for brain tumor segmentation are tedious, subjective and not scalable, and current techniques to determine the methylation status of MGMT promoter involve surgically invasive procedures, which are expensive and time consuming. Hence there is a pressing need to develop automated tools to segment brain tumors and non-invasive methods to predict methylation status of MGMT promoter, to facilitate better treatment planning and improve survival rate. I created an integrated diagnostics solution powered by Artificial Intelligence to automatically segment brain tumor subregions and predict MGMT promoter methylation status, using brain MRI scans. My AI solution is proven on large datasets with performance exceeding current standards and field tested with data from teaching files of local neuroradiologists. With my solution, physicians can submit brain MRI images, and get segmentation and methylation predictions in minutes, and guide brain tumor patients with effective treatment planning and ultimately improve survival time.  
### Unfolded Deep Kernel Estimation for Blind Image Super-resolution. (arXiv:2203.05568v1 [eess.IV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Blind image super-resolution (BISR) aims to reconstruct a high-resolution image from its low-resolution counterpart degraded by unknown blur kernel and noise. Many deep neural network based methods have been proposed to tackle this challenging problem without considering the image degradation model. However, they largely rely on the training sets and often fail to handle images with unseen blur kernels during inference. Deep unfolding methods have also been proposed to perform BISR by utilizing the degradation model. Nonetheless, the existing deep unfolding methods cannot explicitly solve the data term of the unfolding objective function, limiting their capability in blur kernel estimation. In this work, we propose a novel unfolded deep kernel estimation (UDKE) method, which, for the first time to our best knowledge, explicitly solves the data term with high efficiency. The UDKE based BISR method can jointly learn image and kernel priors in an end-to-end manner, and it can effectively exploit the information in both training data and image degradation model. Experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed UDKE method could well predict complex unseen non-Gaussian blur kernels in inference, achieving significantly better BISR performance than state-of-the-art. The source code of UDKE is available at: https://github.com/natezhenghy/UDKE.  
### Autofocusing+: Noise-Resilient Motion Correction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging. (arXiv:2203.05569v1 [eess.IV])

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05569](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05569)
> ABSTRACT  :  Image corruption by motion artifacts is an ingrained problem in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In this work, we propose a neural network-based regularization term to enhance Autofocusing, a classic optimization-based method to remove motion artifacts. The method takes the best of both worlds: the optimization-based routine iteratively executes the blind demotion and deep learning-based prior penalizes for unrealistic **restoration**s and speeds up the convergence. We validate the method on three models of motion trajectories, using synthetic and real noisy data. The method proves resilient to noise and anatomic structure variation, outperforming the state-of-the-art demotion methods.

> ABSTRACT  :  Knowledge of molecular subtypes of gliomas can provide valuable information for tailored therapies. This study aimed to investigate the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for noninvasive glioma subtyping with radiological imaging data according to the new taxonomy announced by the World Health Organization in 2016. Methods: A DCNN model was developed for the prediction of the five glioma subtypes based on a hierarchical classification paradigm. This model used three parallel, weight-sharing, deep residual learning networks to process 2.5-dimensional input of trimodal MRI data, including T1-weighted, T1-weighted with contrast **enhancement**, and T2-weighted images. A data set comprising 1,016 real patients was collected for evaluation of the developed DCNN model. The predictive performance was evaluated via the area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic analysis. For comparison, the performance of a radiomics-based approach was also evaluated. Results: The AUCs of the DCNN model for the four classification tasks in the hierarchical classification paradigm were 0.89, 0.89, 0.85, and 0.66, respectively, as compared to 0.85, 0.75, 0.67, and 0.59 of the radiomics approach. Conclusion: The results showed that the developed DCNN model can predict glioma subtypes with promising performance, given sufficient, non-ill-balanced training data.  
### PC-**Swin**Morph: Patch Representation for Unsupervised Medical Image Registration and Segmentation. (arXiv:2203.05684v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Lihao Liu, Zhening Huang, Pietro Li, Bibiane Sch
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05684](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05684)
> ABSTRACT  :  Medical image registration and segmentation are critical tasks for several clinical procedures. Manual realisation of those tasks is time-consuming and the quality is highly dependent on the level of expertise of the physician. To mitigate that laborious task, automatic tools have been developed where the majority of solutions are supervised techniques. However, in medical domain, the strong assumption of having a well-representative ground truth is far from being realistic. To overcome this challenge, unsupervised techniques have been investigated. However, they are still limited in performance and they fail to produce plausible results. In this work, we propose a novel unified unsupervised framework for image registration and segmentation that we called PC-**Swin**Morph. The core of our framework is two patch-based strategies, where we demonstrate that patch representation is key for performance gain. We first introduce a patch-based contrastive strategy that enforces locality conditions and richer feature representation. Secondly, we utilise a 3D window/shifted-window multi-head self-attention module as a patch stitching strategy to eliminate artifacts from the patch splitting. We demonstrate, through a set of numerical and visual results, that our technique outperforms current state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques.  
### Information-Theoretic Odometry Learning. (arXiv:2203.05724v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Sen Zhang, Jing Zhang, Dacheng Tao
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05724](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05724)
> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we propose a unified information theoretic framework for learning-motivated methods aimed at odometry estimation, a crucial component of many robotics and vision tasks such as navigation and virtual reality where relative camera poses are required in **real time**. We formulate this problem as optimizing a variational information bottleneck objective function, which eliminates pose-irrelevant information from the latent representation. The proposed framework provides an elegant tool for performance evaluation and understanding in information-theoretic language. Specifically, we bound the generalization errors of the deep information bottleneck framework and the predictability of the latent representation. These provide not only a performance guarantee but also practical guidance for model design, sample collection, and sensor selection. Furthermore, the stochastic latent representation provides a natural uncertainty measure without the needs for extra structures or computations. Experiments on two well-known odometry datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.  
### Democracy Does Matter: Comprehensive Feature Mining for Co-Salient Object Detection. (arXiv:2203.05787v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Siyue Yu, Jimin Xiao, Bingfeng Zhang, Eng Gee
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05787](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05787)
> ABSTRACT  :  Co-salient object detection, with the target of detecting co-existed salient objects among a group of images, is gaining popularity. Recent works use the attention mechanism or extra information to aggregate common co-salient features, leading to incomplete even incorrect responses for target objects. In this paper, we aim to mine comprehensive co-salient features with democracy and reduce background interference without introducing any extra information. To achieve this, we design a democratic prototype generation module to generate democratic response maps, covering sufficient co-salient regions and thereby involving more shared attributes of co-salient objects. Then a comprehensive prototype based on the response maps can be generated as a guide for final prediction. To suppress the noisy background information in the prototype, we propose a self-contrastive learning module, where both positive and negative pairs are formed without relying on additional classification information. Besides, we also design a democratic feature **enhancement** module to further strengthen the co-salient features by readjusting attention values. Extensive experiments show that our model obtains better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods, especially on challenging real-world cases (e.g., for CoCA, we obtain a gain of 2.0% for MAE, 5.4% for maximum F-measure, 2.3% for maximum E-measure, and 3.7% for S-measure) under the same settings. Code will be released soon.  
### TAPE: Task-Agnostic Prior Embedding for Image **Restoration**. (arXiv:2203.06074v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Learning an generalized prior for natural image **restoration** is an important yet challenging task. Early methods mostly involved handcrafted priors including normalized sparsity, L0 gradients, **dark** channel priors, etc. Recently, deep neural networks have been used to learn various image priors but do not guarantee to generalize. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that embeds a task-agnostic prior into a transformer. Our approach, named Task-Agnostic Prior Embedding (TAPE), consists of three stages, namely, task-agnostic pre-training, task-agnostic fine-tuning, and task-specific fine-tuning, where the first one embeds prior knowledge about natural images into the transformer and the latter two extracts the knowledge to assist downstream image **restoration**. Experiments on various types of degradation validate the effectiveness of TAPE. The image **restoration** performance in terms of PSNR is improved by as much as 1.45 dB and even outperforms task-specific algorithms. More importantly, TAPE shows the ability of disentangling generalized image priors from degraded images, which enjoys favorable transfer ability to unknown downstream tasks.  
### LFW-Beautified: A Dataset of Face Images with Beautification and Augmented Reality Filters. (arXiv:2203.06082v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Selfie images enjoy huge popularity in social media. The same platforms centered around sharing this type of images offer filters to beautify them or incorporate augmented reality effects. Studies suggests that filtered images attract more views and engagement. Selfie images are also in increasing use in security applications due to mobiles becoming data hubs for many transactions. Also, video conference applications, boomed during the pandemic, include such filters.    Such filters may destroy biometric features that would allow person recognition or even detection of the face itself, even if such commodity applications are not necessarily used to compromise facial systems. This could also affect subsequent investigations like crimes in social media, where automatic analysis is usually necessary given the amount of information posted in social sites or stored in devices or cloud repositories.    To help in counteracting such issues, we contribute with a database of facial images that includes several manipulations. It includes image **enhancement** filters (which mostly modify contrast and lightning) and augmented reality filters that incorporate items like animal noses or glasses. Additionally, images with sunglasses are processed with a reconstruction network trained to learn to reverse such modifications. This is because obfuscating the eye region has been observed in the literature to have the highest impact on the accuracy of face detection or recognition.    We start from the popular Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) database, to which we apply different modifications, generating 8 datasets. Each dataset contains 4,324 images of size 64 x 64, with a total of 34,592 images. The use of a public and widely employed face dataset allows for replication and comparison.    The created database is available at https://github.com/HalmstadUniversityBiometrics/LFW-Beautified  
### Monocular **Real-time** Hand Shape and Motion Capture using Multi-modal Data. (arXiv:2003.09572v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  We present a novel method for monocular hand shape and pose estimation at unprecedented runtime performance of 100fps and at state-of-the-art accuracy. This is enabled by a new learning based architecture designed such that it can make use of all the sources of available hand training data: image data with either 2D or 3D annotations, as well as stand-alone 3D animations without corresponding image data. It features a 3D hand joint detection module and an inverse kinematics module which regresses not only 3D joint positions but also maps them to joint rotations in a single feed-forward pass. This output makes the method more directly usable for applications in computer vision and graphics compared to only regressing 3D joint positions. We demonstrate that our architectural design leads to a significant quantitative and qualitative improvement over the state of the art on several challenging benchmarks. Our model is publicly available for future research.  
### Restormer: Efficient Transformer for High-Resolution Image **Restoration**. (arXiv:2111.09881v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Since convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform well at learning generalizable image priors from large-scale data, these models have been extensively applied to image **restoration** and related tasks. Recently, another class of neural architectures, Transformers, have shown significant performance gains on natural language and high-level vision tasks. While the Transformer model mitigates the shortcomings of CNNs (i.e., limited receptive field and inadaptability to input content), its computational complexity grows quadratically with the spatial resolution, therefore making it infeasible to apply to most image **restoration** tasks involving high-resolution images. In this work, we propose an efficient Transformer model by making several key designs in the building blocks (multi-head attention and feed-forward network) such that it can capture long-range pixel interactions, while still remaining applicable to large images. Our model, named **Restoration** Transformer (Restormer), achieves state-of-the-art results on several image **restoration** tasks, including image deraining, single-image motion deblurring, defocus deblurring (single-image and dual-pixel data), and image denoising (Gaussian grayscale/color denoising, and real image denoising). The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/swz30/Restormer.

### An Efficient Video Streaming Architecture with QoS Control for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure in Cloud Computing. (arXiv:2203.05735v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  In virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environments, the remote display protocol has a big responsibility to transmit video data from a data center-hosted desktop to the endpoint. The protocol must ensure a high level of client perceived end-to-end quality of service (QoS) under heavy work load conditions. Each remote display protocol works differently depending on the network and which applications are being delivered. In healthcare applications, doctors and nurses can use mobile devices directly to monitor patients. Moreover, the ability to implement tasks requiring high consumption of CPU and other resources is applicable to a variety of applications including research and cloud gaming. Such computer games and complex processes will run on powerful cloud servers and the screen contents will be transmitted to the client. TO enable such applications, remote display technology requires further **enhancement**s to meet more stringent requirements on bandwidth and QoS, an to allow realtime operation. In this paper, we present an architecture including flexible QoS control to improve the user quality of experience (QoE). The QoS control is developed based on linear regression modeling using historical network data. Additionally, the architecture includes a novel compression algorithm of 2D images, designed to guarantee the best image quality and to reduce video delay; this algorithm is based on k-means clustering and can satisfy the requirements of realtime onboard processing. Through simulations with a real work dataset collected by the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Lab, we present experimental as well as explain the performance of the QoS system.  
### Exploiting Low-Rank Tensor-Train Deep Neural Networks Based on Riemannian Gradient Descent With Illustrations of Speech Processing. (arXiv:2203.06031v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Jun Qi, Han Huck, Yu Chen, Javier Tejedor
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06031](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06031)
> ABSTRACT  :  This work focuses on designing low complexity hybrid tensor networks by considering trade-offs between the model complexity and practical performance. Firstly, we exploit a low-rank tensor-train deep neural network (TT-DNN) to build an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, namely LR-TT-DNN. Secondly, a hybrid model combining LR-TT-DNN with a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is denoted as CNN+(LR-TT-DNN), is set up to boost the performance. Instead of randomly assigning large TT-ranks for TT-DNN, we leverage Riemannian gradient descent to determine a TT-DNN associated with small TT-ranks. Furthermore, CNN+(LR-TT-DNN) consists of convolutional layers at the bottom for feature extraction and several TT layers at the top to solve regression and classification problems. We separately assess the LR-TT-DNN and CNN+(LR-TT-DNN) models on speech **enhancement** and spoken command recognition tasks. Our empirical evidence demonstrates that the LR-TT-DNN and CNN+(LR-TT-DNN) models with fewer model parameters can outperform the TT-DNN and CNN+(TT-DNN) counterparts.  
### Training Heterogeneous Features in Sequence to Sequence Tasks: Latent Enhanced Multi-filter Seq2Seq Model. (arXiv:2105.08840v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)
- Authors : Yunhao Yang, Zhaokun Xue
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08840](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08840)
> ABSTRACT  :  In language processing, training data with extremely large variance may lead to difficulty of language model's convergence. It is difficult for the network parameters to adapt sentences with largely varied semantics or grammatical structures. To resolve this problem, we introduce a model that concentrates the each of the heterogeneous features in the input sentences. Build upon the encoder-decoder architecture, we design a latent-enhanced multi-filter seq2seq model (LEMS) that analyzes the input representations by introducing a latent space transformation and clustering. The representations are extracted from the final hidden state of the encoder and lie in the latent space. A latent space transformation is applied for enhancing the quality of the representations. Thus the clustering algorithm can easily separate samples based on the features of these representations. Multiple filters are trained by the features from their corresponding clusters, the heterogeneity of the training data can be resolved accordingly. We conduct two sets of comparative experiments on semantic parsing and machine translation, using the Geo-query dataset and Multi30k English-French to demonstrate the **enhancement** our model has made respectively.

Instead of randomly assigning large TT-ranks for TT-DNN, we leverage Riemannian gradient descent to determine a TT-DNN associated with small TT-ranks. Furthermore, CNN+(LR-TT-DNN) consists of convolutional layers at the bottom for feature extraction and several TT layers at the top to solve regression and classification problems. We separately assess the LR-TT-DNN and CNN+(LR-TT-DNN) models on speech **enhancement** and spoken command recognition tasks. Our empirical evidence demonstrates that the LR-TT-DNN and CNN+(LR-TT-DNN) models with fewer model parameters can outperform the TT-DNN and CNN+(TT-DNN) counterparts.
