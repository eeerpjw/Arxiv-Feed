> ABSTRACT  :  Augmented reality applications have rapidly spread across online platforms, allowing consumers to virtually try-on a variety of products, such as makeup, hair dying, or shoes. However, parametrizing a renderer to synthesize realistic images of a given product remains a challenging task that requires expert knowledge. While recent work has introduced neural rendering methods for virtual try-on from example images, current approaches are based on large generative models that cannot be used in real-time on mobile devices. This calls for a hybrid method that combines the advantages of computer graphics and neural rendering approaches. In this paper we propose a novel framework based on deep learning to build a real-time inverse graphics encoder that learns to map a single example image into the parameter space of a given augmented reality rendering engine. Our method leverages self-supervised learning and does not require labeled training data which makes it extendable to many virtual try-on applications. Furthermore, most augmented reality renderers are not differentiable in practice due to algorithmic choices or implementation constraints to reach real-time on portable devices. To relax the need for a graphics-based differentiable renderer in inverse graphics problems, we introduce a trainable imitator module. Our imitator is a generative network that learns to accurately reproduce the behavior of a given non-differentiable renderer. We propose a novel rendering sensitivity loss to train the imitator, which ensures that the network learns an accurate and continuous representation for each rendering parameter. Our framework enables novel applications where consumers can virtually try-on a novel unknown product from an inspirational reference image on social media. It can also be used by graphics artists to automatically create realistic rendering from a reference product image.

> ABSTRACT  :  Owing to the rapid development of sensor technology, hyperspectral (HS) remote sensing (RS) imaging has provided a significant amount of spatial and spectral information for the observation and analysis of the Earth's surface at a distance of data acquisition devices, such as aircraft, spacecraft, and satellite. The recent advancement and even revolution of the HS RS technique offer opportunities to realize the full potential of various applications, while confronting new challenges for efficiently processing and analyzing the enormous HS acquisition data. Due to the maintenance of the 3-D HS inherent structure, tensor decomposition has aroused widespread concern and research in HS data processing tasks over the past decades. In this article, we aim at presenting a comprehensive overview of tensor decomposition, specifically contextualizing the five broad topics in HS data processing, and they are HS **restoration**, compressed sensing, anomaly detection, super-resolution, and spectral unmixing. For each topic, we elaborate on the remarkable achievements of tensor decomposition models for HS RS with a pivotal description of the existing methodologies and a representative exhibition on the experimental results. As a result, the remaining challenges of the follow-up research directions are outlined and discussed from the perspective of the real HS RS practices and tensor decomposition merged with advanced priors and even with deep neural networks. This article summarizes different tensor decomposition-based HS data processing methods and categorizes them into different classes from simple adoptions to complex combinations with other priors for the algorithm beginners. We also expect this survey can provide new investigations and development trends for the experienced researchers who understand tensor decomposition and HS RS to some extent.  
### VQFR: Blind Face **Restoration** with Vector-Quantized Dictionary and Parallel Decoder. (arXiv:2205.06803v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Although generative facial prior and geometric prior have recently demonstrated high-quality results for blind face **restoration**, producing fine-grained facial details faithful to inputs remains a challenging problem. Motivated by the classical dictionary-based methods and the recent vector quantization (VQ) technique, we propose a VQ-based face **restoration** method -- VQFR. VQFR takes advantage of high-quality low-level feature banks extracted from high-quality faces and can thus help recover realistic facial details. However, the simple application of the VQ codebook cannot achieve good results with faithful details and identity preservation. Therefore, we further introduce two special network designs. 1). We first investigate the compression patch size in the VQ codebook and find that the VQ codebook designed with a proper compression patch size is crucial to balance the quality and fidelity. 2). To further fuse low-level features from inputs while not "contaminating" the realistic details generated from the VQ codebook, we proposed a parallel decoder consisting of a texture decoder and a main decoder. Those two decoders then interact with a texture warping module with deformable convolution. Equipped with the VQ codebook as a facial detail dictionary and the parallel decoder design, the proposed VQFR can largely enhance the restored quality of facial details while keeping the fidelity to previous methods. Codes will be available at https://github.com/TencentARC/VQFR.  
### FaDIV-Syn: Fast Depth-Independent View Synthesis using Soft Masks and Implicit Blending. (arXiv:2106.13139v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Andre Rochow, Max Schwarz, Michael Weinmann, Sven Behnke
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13139](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13139)
> ABSTRACT  :  Novel view synthesis is required in many robotic applications, such as VR teleoperation and scene reconstruction. Existing methods are often too slow for these contexts, cannot handle dynamic scenes, and are limited by their explicit depth estimation stage, where incorrect depth predictions can lead to large projection errors. Our proposed method runs in **real time** on live streaming data and avoids explicit depth estimation by efficiently warping input images into the target frame for a range of assumed depth planes. The resulting plane sweep volume (PSV) is directly fed into our network, which first estimates soft PSV masks in a self-supervised manner, and then directly produces the novel output view. This improves efficiency and performance on transparent, reflective, thin, and feature-less scene parts. FaDIV-Syn can perform both interpolation and extrapolation tasks at 540p in real-time and outperforms state-of-the-art extrapolation methods on the large-scale RealEstate10k dataset. We thoroughly evaluate ablations, such as removing the Soft-Masking network, training from fewer examples as well as generalization to higher resolutions and stronger depth discretization. Our implementation is available.  
### MEWS: **Real-time** Social Media Manipulation Detection and Analysis. (arXiv:2205.05783v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : William Theisen, Michael Yankoski, Tom Henry, Farah Khashman, Tim Weninger
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05783](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05783)
> ABSTRACT  :  This article presents a beta-version of MEWS (Misinformation Early Warning System). It describes the various aspects of the ingestion, manipulation detection, and graphing algorithms employed to determine--in near real-time--the relationships between social media images as they emerge and spread on social media platforms. By combining these various technologies into a single processing pipeline, MEWS can identify manipulated media items as they arise and identify when these particular items begin trending on individual social media platforms or even across multiple platforms. The emergence of a novel manipulation followed by rapid diffusion of the manipulated content suggests a disinformation campaign.

### Neurochaos Feature Transformation and Classification for Imbalanced Learning. (arXiv:2205.06742v1 [cs.NE])
- Authors : Deeksha Sethi, Nithin Nagaraj
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06742](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06742)
> ABSTRACT  :  Learning from limited and imbalanced data is a challenging problem in the Artificial Intelligence community. **Real-time** scenarios demand decision-making from rare events wherein the data are typically imbalanced. These situations commonly arise in medical applications, cybersecurity, catastrophic predictions etc. This motivates development of learning algorithms capable of learning from imbalanced data. Human brain effortlessly learns from imbalanced data. Inspired by the chaotic neuronal firing in the human brain, a novel learning algorithm namely \emph{Neurochaos Learning} (NL) was recently proposed. NL is categorized in three blocks: Feature Transformation, Neurochaos Feature Extraction (CFX), and Classification. In this work, the efficacy of neurochaos feature transformation and extraction for classification in imbalanced learning is studied. We propose a unique combination of neurochaos based feature transformation and extraction with traditional ML algorithms. The explored datasets in this study revolve around medical diagnosis, banknote fraud detection, environmental applications and spoken-digit classification. In this study, experiments are performed in both high and low training sample regime. In the former, five out of nine datasets have shown a performance boost in terms of macro F1-score after using CFX features. The highest performance boost obtained is $\textbf{25.97\%}$ for {\it Statlog (Heart)} dataset using CFX+Decision Tree. In the low training sample regime (from just one to nine training samples per class), the highest performance boost of $\textbf{144.38\%}$ is obtained for {\it Haberman's Survival} dataset using CFX+Random Forest. NL offers enormous flexibility of combining CFX with any ML classifier to boost its performance, especially for learning tasks with limited and imbalanced data.  
### Improving Astronomical Time-series Classification via Data Augmentation with Generative Adversarial Networks. (arXiv:2205.06758v1 [astro-ph.IM])
- Authors : Pavlos Protopapas
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06758](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06758)
> ABSTRACT  :  Due to the latest advances in technology, telescopes with significant sky coverage will produce millions of astronomical alerts per **night** that must be classified both rapidly and automatically. Currently, classification consists of supervised machine learning algorithms whose performance is limited by the number of existing annotations of astronomical objects and their highly imbalanced class distributions. In this work, we propose a data augmentation methodology based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate a variety of synthetic light curves from variable stars. Our novel contributions, consisting of a resampling technique and an evaluation metric, can assess the quality of generative models in unbalanced datasets and identify GAN-overfitting cases that the Fr\'echet Inception Distance does not reveal. We applied our proposed model to two datasets taken from the Catalina and Zwicky Transient Facility surveys. The classification accuracy of variable stars is improved significantly when training with synthetic data and testing with real data with respect to the case of using only real data.  
### A Machine Learning Analysis of Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Alcohol Consumption Habit Changes Among Healthcare Workers in the U.S. (arXiv:2112.06261v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we discuss the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on alcohol consumption habit changes among healthcare workers in the United States. We utilize multiple supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and models such as Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer perceptron, Random Forests, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Synthetic Minority Oversampling, Chi-Squared Test and mutual information method on a mental health survey data obtained from the University of Michigan Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research to find out relationships between COVID-19 related negative effects and alcohol consumption habit changes among healthcare workers. Our findings suggest that COVID-19-related school closures, COVID-19-related work schedule changes and COVID-related news **exposure** may lead to an increase in alcohol use among healthcare workers in the United States.  
### Discovering the building blocks of **dark** matter halo density profiles with neural networks. (arXiv:2203.08827v2 [astro-ph.CO] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08827](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08827)
> ABSTRACT  :  The density profiles of **dark** matter halos are typically modeled using empirical formulae fitted to the density profiles of relaxed halo populations. We present a neural network model that is trained to learn the mapping from the raw density field containing each halo to the **dark** matter density profile. We show that the model recovers the widely-used Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile out to the virial radius, and can additionally describe the variability in the outer profile of the halos. The neural network architecture consists of a supervised encoder-decoder framework, which first compresses the density inputs into a low-dimensional latent representation, and then outputs $\rho(r)$ for any desired value of radius $r$. The latent representation contains all the information used by the model to predict the density profiles. This allows us to interpret the latent representation by quantifying the mutual information between the representation and the halos' ground-truth density profiles. A two-dimensional representation is sufficient to accurately model the density profiles up to the virial radius; however, a three-dimensional representation is required to describe the outer profiles beyond the virial radius. The additional dimension in the representation contains information about the infalling material in the outer profiles of **dark** matter halos, thus discovering the splashback boundary of halos without prior knowledge of the halos' dynamical history.

> ABSTRACT  :  Accelerated ripening through the **exposure** of fruits to controlled environmental conditions and gases is nowadays one of the most assessed food technologies, especially for climacteric and exotic products. However, a fine granularity control of the process and consequently of the quality of the goods is still missing, so the management of the ripening rooms is mainly based on qualitative estimations only. Following the modern paradigms of Industry 4.0, this contribution proposes a non-destructive RFID-based system for the automatic evaluation of the live ripening of avocados. The system, coupled with a properly trained automatic classification algorithm based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), can discriminate the stage of ripening with an accuracy greater than 85%.
