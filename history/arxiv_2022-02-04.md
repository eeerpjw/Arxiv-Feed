> ABSTRACT  :  Rain often poses inevitable threats to deep neural network (DNN) based perception systems, and a comprehensive investigation of the potential risks of the rain to DNNs is of great importance. However, it is rather difficult to collect or synthesize rainy images that can represent all rain situations that would possibly occur in the real world. To this end, in this paper, we start from a new perspective and propose to combine two totally different studies, i.e., rainy image synthesis and adversarial attack. We first present an adversarial rain attack, with which we could simulate various rain situations with the guidance of deployed DNNs and reveal the potential threat factors that can be brought by rain. In particular, we design a factor-aware rain generation that synthesizes rain streaks according to the camera **exposure** process and models the learnable rain factors for adversarial attack. With this generator, we perform the adversarial rain attack against the image classification and object detection. To defend the DNNs from the negative rain effect, we also present a defensive deraining strategy, for which we design an adversarial rain augmentation that uses mixed adversarial rain layers to enhance deraining models for downstream DNN perception. Our large-scale evaluation on various datasets demonstrates that our synthesized rainy images with realistic appearances not only exhibit strong adversarial capability against DNNs, but also boost the deraining models for defensive purposes, building the foundation for further rain-robust perception studies.  
### Bridging the Gap between Events and Frames through Unsupervised Domain Adaptation. (arXiv:2109.02618v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Reliable perception during fast motion maneuvers or in **high dynamic range** environments is crucial for robotic systems. Since event cameras are robust to these challenging conditions, they have great potential to increase the reliability of robot vision. However, event-based vision has been held back by the shortage of labeled datasets due to the novelty of event cameras. To overcome this drawback, we propose a task transfer method to train models directly with labeled images and unlabeled event data. Compared to previous approaches, (i) our method transfers from single images to events instead of high frame rate videos, and (ii) does not rely on paired sensor data. To achieve this, we leverage the generative event model to split event features into content and motion features. This split enables efficient matching between latent spaces for events and images, which is crucial for successful task transfer. Thus, our approach unlocks the vast amount of existing image datasets for the training of event-based neural networks. Our task transfer method consistently outperforms methods targeting Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for object detection by 0.26 mAP (increase by 93%) and classification by 2.7% accuracy.

> ABSTRACT  :  In our current society, the inter-connectivity of devices provides easy access for netizens to utilize cyberspace technology for illegal activities. The deep web platform is a consummative ecosystem shielded by boundaries of trust, information sharing, trade-off, and review systems. Domain knowledge is shared among experts in hacker's forums which contain indicators of compromise that can be explored for cyberthreat intelligence. Developing tools that can be deployed for threat detection is integral in securing digital communication in cyberspace. In this paper, we addressed the use of TOR relay nodes for anonymizing communications in deep web forums. We propose a novel approach for detecting cyberthreats using a deep learning algorithm Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The developed model outperformed the experimental results of other researchers in this problem domain with an accuracy of 94\% and precision of 90\%. Our model can be easily deployed by organizations in securing digital communications and detection of vulnerability **exposure** before cyberattack.

> ABSTRACT  :  The harmful impacts of algorithmic decision systems have recently come into focus, with many examples of systems such as machine learning (ML) models amplifying existing societal biases. Most metrics attempting to quantify disparities resulting from ML algorithms focus on differences between groups, dividing users based on demographic identities and comparing model performance or overall outcomes between these groups. However, in industry settings, such information is often not available, and inferring these characteristics carries its own risks and biases. Moreover, typical metrics that focus on a single classifier's output ignore the complex network of systems that produce outcomes in real-world settings. In this paper, we evaluate a set of metrics originating from economics, distributional inequality metrics, and their ability to measure disparities in content **exposure** in a production recommendation system, the Twitter algorithmic timeline. We define desirable criteria for metrics to be used in an operational setting, specifically by ML practitioners. We characterize different types of engagement with content on Twitter using these metrics, and use these results to evaluate the metrics with respect to the desired criteria. We show that we can use these metrics to identify content suggestion algorithms that contribute more strongly to skewed outcomes between users. Overall, we conclude that these metrics can be useful tools for understanding disparate outcomes in online social networks.
