### How Many Events do You Need? Event-based Visual Place Recognition Using Sparse But Varying Pixels. (arXiv:2206.13673v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Tobias Fischer, Michael Milford

> ABSTRACT  :  Event cameras continue to attract interest due to desirable characteristics such as **high dynamic range**, low latency, virtually no motion blur, and high energy efficiency. One of the potential applications of event camera research lies in visual place recognition for robot localization, where a query observation has to be matched to the corresponding reference place in the database. In this letter, we explore the distinctiveness of event streams from a small subset of pixels (in the tens or hundreds). We demonstrate that the absolute difference in the number of events at those pixel locations accumulated into event frames can be sufficient for the place recognition task, when pixels that display large variations in the reference set are used. Using such sparse (over image coordinates) but varying (variance over the number of events per pixel location) pixels enables frequent and computationally cheap updates of the location estimates. Furthermore, when event frames contain a constant number of events, our method takes full advantage of the event-driven nature of the sensory stream and displays promising robustness to changes in velocity. We evaluate our proposed approach on the Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset in an outdoor driving scenario, as well as the newly contributed indoor QCR-Event-VPR dataset that was captured with a DAVIS346 camera mounted on a mobile robotic platform. Our results show that our approach achieves competitive performance when compared to several baseline methods on those datasets, and is particularly well suited for compute- and energy-constrained platforms such as interplanetary rovers.

> ABSTRACT  :  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is indispensable for machine learning models deployed in the open world. Recently, the use of an auxiliary outlier dataset during training (also known as outlier **exposure**) has shown promising performance. As the sample space for potential OOD data can be prohibitively large, sampling informative outliers is essential. In this work, we propose a novel posterior sampling-based outlier mining framework, POEM, which facilitates efficient use of outlier data and promotes learning a compact decision boundary between ID and OOD data for improved detection. We show that POEM establishes state-of-the-art performance on common benchmarks. Compared to the current best method that uses a greedy sampling strategy, POEM improves the relative performance by 42.0% and 24.2% (FPR95) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. We further provide theoretical insights on the effectiveness of POEM for OOD detection.

> ABSTRACT  :  Self-supervised deep learning methods for joint depth and ego-motion estimation can yield accurate trajectories without needing ground-truth training data. However, as they typically use photometric losses, their performance can degrade significantly when the assumptions these losses make (e.g. temporal illumination consistency, a static scene, and the absence of noise and occlusions) are violated. This limits their use for e.g. **night**time sequences, which tend to contain many point light sources (including on dynamic objects) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in **dark**er image regions. In this paper, we show how to use a combination of three techniques to allow the existing photometric losses to work for both day and **night**time images. First, we introduce a per-pixel neural intensity transformation to compensate for the light changes that occur between successive frames. Second, we predict a per-pixel residual flow map that we use to correct the reprojection correspondences induced by the estimated ego-motion and depth from the networks. And third, we denoise the training images to improve the robustness and accuracy of our approach. These changes allow us to train a single model for both day and **night**time images without needing separate encoders or extra feature networks like existing methods. We perform extensive experiments and ablation studies on the challenging Oxford RobotCar dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for both day and **night**time sequences.  
### Accurate and **Real-time** Pseudo Lidar Detection: Is Stereo Neural Network Really Necessary?. (arXiv:2206.13858v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Haitao Meng, Changcai Li, Gang Chen, Alois Knoll
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13858](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13858)
> ABSTRACT  :  The proposal of Pseudo-Lidar representation has significantly narrowed the gap between visual-based and active Lidar-based 3D object detection. However, current researches exclusively focus on pushing the accuracy improvement of Pseudo-Lidar by taking the advantage of complex and time-consuming neural networks. Seldom explore the profound characteristics of Pseudo-Lidar representation to obtain the promoting opportunities. In this paper, we dive deep into the pseudo Lidar representation and argue that the performance of 3D object detection is not fully dependent on the high precision stereo depth estimation. We demonstrate that even for the unreliable depth estimation, with proper data processing and refining, it can achieve comparable 3D object detection accuracy. With this finding, we further show the possibility that utilizing fast but inaccurate stereo matching algorithms in the Pseudo-Lidar system to achieve low latency responsiveness. In the experiments, we develop a system with a less powerful stereo matching predictor and adopt the proposed refinement schemes to improve the accuracy. The evaluation on the KITTI benchmark shows that the presented system achieves competitive accuracy to the state-of-the-art approaches with only 23 ms computing, showing it is a suitable candidate for deploying to real car-hold applications.  
### Multi-Prior Learning via Neural Architecture Search for Blind Face **Restoration**. (arXiv:2206.13962v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Blind Face **Restoration** (BFR) aims to recover high-quality face images from low-quality ones and usually resorts to facial priors for improving **restoration** performance. However, current methods still suffer from two major difficulties: 1) how to derive a powerful network architecture without extensive hand tuning; 2) how to capture complementary information from multiple facial priors in one network to improve **restoration** performance. To this end, we propose a Face **Restoration** Searching Network (FRSNet) to adaptively search the suitable feature extraction architecture within our specified search space, which can directly contribute to the **restoration** quality. On the basis of FRSNet, we further design our Multiple Facial Prior Searching Network (MFPSNet) with a multi-prior learning scheme. MFPSNet optimally extracts information from diverse facial priors and fuses the information into image features, ensuring that both external guidance and internal features are reserved. In this way, MFPSNet takes full advantage of semantic-level (parsing maps), geometric-level (facial heatmaps), reference-level (facial dictionaries) and pixel-level (degraded images) information and thus generates faithful and realistic images. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that MFPSNet performs favorably on both synthetic and real-world datasets against the state-of-the-art BFR methods. The codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/YYJ1anG/MFPSNet.  
### Deep Variational Network Toward Blind Image **Restoration**. (arXiv:2008.10796v3 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Blind image **restoration** (IR) is a common yet challenging problem in computer vision. Classical model-based methods and recent deep learning (DL)-based methods represent two different methodologies for this problem, each with their own merits and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image **restoration** method, aiming to integrate both the advantages of them. Specifically, we construct a general Bayesian generative model for the blind IR, which explicitly depicts the degradation process. In this proposed model, a pixel-wise non-i.i.d. Gaussian distribution is employed to fit the image noise. It is with more flexibility than the simple i.i.d. Gaussian or Laplacian distributions as adopted in most of conventional methods, so as to handle more complicated noise types contained in the image degradation. To solve the model, we design a variational inference algorithm where all the expected posteriori distributions are parameterized as deep neural networks to increase their model capability. Notably, such an inference algorithm induces a unified framework to jointly deal with the tasks of degradation estimation and image **restoration**. Further, the degradation information estimated in the former task is utilized to guide the latter IR process. Experiments on two typical blind IR tasks, namely image denoising and super-resolution, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-arts.  
### Multiview Textured Mesh Recovery by Differentiable Rendering. (arXiv:2205.12468v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Although having achieved the promising results on shape and color recovery through self-supervision, the multi-layer perceptrons-based methods usually suffer from heavy computational cost on learning the deep implicit surface representation. Since rendering each pixel requires a forward network inference, it is very computational intensive to synthesize a whole image. To tackle these challenges, we propose an effective coarse-to-fine approach to recover the textured mesh from multi-views in this paper. Specifically, a differentiable Poisson Solver is employed to represent the object's shape, which is able to produce topology-agnostic and watertight surfaces. To account for depth information, we optimize the shape geometry by minimizing the differences between the rendered mesh and the predicted depth from multi-view stereo. In contrast to the **implicit neural representation** on shape and color, we introduce a physically based inverse rendering scheme to jointly estimate the environment lighting and object's reflectance, which is able to render the high resolution image at real-time. The texture of the reconstructed mesh is interpolated from a learnable dense texture grid. We have conducted the extensive experiments on several multi-view stereo datasets, whose promising results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/l1346792580123/diff.  
### Augmented Imagefication: A Data-driven Fault Detection Method for Aircraft Air Data Sensors. (arXiv:2206.09055v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, a novel data-driven approach named Augmented Imagefication for Fault detection (FD) of aircraft air data sensors (ADS) is proposed. Exemplifying the FD problem of aircraft air data sensors, an online FD scheme on edge device based on deep neural network (DNN) is developed. First, the aircraft inertial reference unit measurements is adopted as equivalent inputs, which is scalable to different aircraft/flight cases. Data associated with 6 different aircraft/flight conditions are collected to provide diversity (scalability) in the training/testing database. Then Augmented Imagefication is proposed for the DNN-based prediction of flying conditions. The raw data are reshaped as a grayscale image for convolutional operation, and the necessity of augmentation is analyzed and pointed out. Different kinds of augmented method, i.e. Flip, Repeat, Tile and their combinations are discussed, the result shows that the All Repeat operation in both axes of image matrix leads to the best performance of DNN. The interpretability of DNN is studied based on Grad-CAM, which provide a better understanding and further solidifies the robustness of DNN. Next the DNN model, VGG-16 with augmented imagefication data is optimized for mobile hardware deployment. After pruning of DNN, a lightweight model (98.79% smaller than original VGG-16) with high accuracy (slightly up by 0.27%) and fast speed (time delay is reduced by 87.54%) is obtained. And the hyperparameters optimization of DNN based on TPE is implemented and the best combination of hyperparameters is determined (learning rate 0.001, iterative epochs 600, and batch size 100 yields the highest accuracy at 0.987). Finally, a online FD deployment based on edge device, Jetson Nano, is developed and the **real time** monitoring of aircraft is achieved. We believe that this method is instructive for addressing the FD problems in other similar fields.

> ABSTRACT  :  **Real-time** bidding is the new paradigm of programmatic advertising. An advertiser wants to make the intelligent choice of utilizing a \textbf{Demand-Side Platform} to improve the performance of their ad campaigns. Existing approaches are struggling to provide a satisfactory solution for bidding optimization due to stochastic bidding behavior. In this paper, we proposed a multi-agent reinforcement learning architecture for RTB with functional optimization. We designed four agents bidding environment: three Lagrange-multiplier based functional optimization agents and one baseline agent (without any attribute of functional optimization) First, numerous attributes have been assigned to each agent, including biased or unbiased win probability, Lagrange multiplier, and click-through rate. In order to evaluate the proposed RTB strategy's performance, we demonstrate the results on ten sequential simulated auction campaigns. The results show that agents with functional actions and rewards had the most significant average winning rate and winning surplus, given biased and unbiased winning information respectively. The experimental evaluations show that our approach significantly improve the campaign's efficacy and profitability.

> ABSTRACT  :  Distributional reinforcement learning demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in continuous and discrete control settings with the features of variance and risk, which can be used to explore. However, the exploration method employing the risk property is hard to find, although numerous exploration methods in Distributional RL employ the variance of return distribution per action. In this paper, we present risk scheduling approaches that explore risk levels and optimistic behaviors from a risk perspective. We demonstrate the performance **enhancement** of the DMIX algorithm using risk scheduling in a multi-agent setting with comprehensive experiments.  
### EMVLight: A Decentralized Reinforcement Learning Framework for Efficient Passage of Emergency Vehicles. (arXiv:2109.05429v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Emergency vehicles (EMVs) play a crucial role in responding to time-critical events such as medical emergencies and fire outbreaks in an urban area. The less time EMVs spend traveling through the traffic, the more likely it would help save people's lives and reduce property loss. To reduce the travel time of EMVs, prior work has used route optimization based on historical traffic-flow data and traffic signal pre-emption based on the optimal route. However, traffic signal pre-emption dynamically changes the traffic flow which, in turn, modifies the optimal route of an EMV. In addition, traffic signal pre-emption practices usually lead to significant disturbances in traffic flow and subsequently increase the travel time for non-EMVs. In this paper, we propose EMVLight, a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework for simultaneous dynamic routing and traffic signal control. EMVLight extends Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently update the optimal route for the EMVs in **real time** as it travels through the traffic network. The decentralized RL agents learn network-level cooperative traffic signal phase strategies that not only reduce EMV travel time but also reduce the average travel time of non-EMVs in the network. This benefit has been demonstrated through comprehensive experiments with synthetic and real-world maps. These experiments show that EMVLight outperforms benchmark transportation engineering techniques and existing RL-based signal control methods.  
### Detecting potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content on twitter: A machine learning approach. (arXiv:2112.04796v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Research shows that **exposure** to suicide-related news media content is associated with suicide rates, with some content characteristics likely having harmful and others potentially protective effects. Although good evidence exists for a few selected characteristics, systematic large scale investigations are missing in general, and in particular for social media data. We apply machine learning methods to classify large quantities of Twitter data according to a novel annotation scheme that distinguishes 12 categories of suicide-related tweets. We then trained a benchmark of machine learning models including a majority classifier, an approach based on word frequency (TF-IDF with a linear SVM) and two state-of-the-art deep learning models (BERT, XLNet). The two deep learning models achieved the best performance in two classification tasks: In the first task, we classified six main content categories, including personal stories about either suicidal ideation and attempts or coping, calls for action intending to spread either problem awareness or prevention-related information, reporting of suicide cases, and other tweets irrelevant to these categories. The deep learning models reached accuracy scores above 73% on average across the six categories, and F1-scores in between 0.70 and 0.85 for all but the suicidal ideation and attempts category (0.51-0.55). In the second task, separating tweets referring to actual suicide from off-topic tweets, they correctly labeled around 88% of tweets, with BERT achieving F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.74 for the two categories, respectively. These classification performances are comparable to the state-of-the-art on similar tasks. By making data labeling more efficient, this work has enabled large-scale investigations on harmful and protective associations of social media content with suicide rates and help-seeking behavior.

> ABSTRACT  :  Test point insertion (TPI) is a widely used technique for testability **enhancement**, especially for logic built-in self-test (LBIST) due to its relatively low fault coverage. In this paper, we propose a novel TPI approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), named DeepTPI. Unlike previous learning-based solutions that formulate the TPI task as a supervised-learning problem, we train a novel DRL agent, instantiated as the combination of a graph neural network (GNN) and a Deep Q-Learning network (DQN), to maximize the test coverage improvement. Specifically, we model circuits as directed graphs and design a graph-based value network to estimate the action values for inserting different test points. The policy of the DRL agent is defined as selecting the action with the maximum value. Moreover, we apply the general node embeddings from a pre-trained model to enhance node features, and propose a dedicated testability-aware attention mechanism for the value network. Experimental results on circuits with various scales show that DeepTPI significantly improves test coverage compared to the commercial DFT tool.
