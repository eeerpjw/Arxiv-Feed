### An Asynchronous Kalman Filter for Hybrid Event Cameras. (arXiv:2012.05590v4 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Event cameras are ideally suited to capture **HDR** visual information without blur but perform poorly on static or slowly changing scenes. Conversely, conventional image sensors measure absolute intensity of slowly changing scenes effectively but do poorly on **high dynamic range** or quickly changing scenes. In this paper, we present an event-based video reconstruction pipeline for **High Dynamic Range** (**HDR**) scenarios. The proposed algorithm includes a frame augmentation pre-processing step that deblurs and temporally interpolates frame data using events. The augmented frame and event data are then fused using a novel asynchronous Kalman filter under a unifying uncertainty model for both sensors. Our experimental results are evaluated on both publicly available datasets with challenging lighting conditions and fast motions and our new dataset with **HDR** reference. The proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both absolute intensity error (48% reduction) and image similarity indexes (average 11% improvement).  
### Pik-Fix: Restoring and Colorizing Old Photos. (arXiv:2205.01902v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Restoring and inpainting the visual memories that are present, but often impaired, in old photos remains an intriguing but unsolved research topic. Decades-old photos often suffer from severe and commingled degradation such as cracks, defocus, and color-fading, which are difficult to treat individually and harder to repair when they interact. Deep learning presents a plausible avenue, but the lack of large-scale datasets of old photos makes addressing this **restoration** task very challenging. Here we present a novel reference-based end-to-end learning framework that is able to both repair and colorize old and degraded pictures. Our proposed framework consists of three modules: a **restoration** sub-network that conducts **restoration** from degradations, a similarity sub-network that performs color histogram matching and color transfer, and a colorization subnet that learns to predict the chroma elements of images that have been conditioned on chromatic reference signals. The overall system makes use of color histogram priors from reference images, which greatly reduces the need for large-scale training data. We have also created a first-of-a-kind public dataset of real old photos that are paired with ground truth "pristine" photos that have been that have been manually restored by PhotoShop experts. We conducted extensive experiments on this dataset and synthetic datasets, and found that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models using both qualitative comparisons and quantitative measurements.

### A Memory-Efficient Dynamic Image Reconstruction Method using Neural Fields. (arXiv:2205.05585v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors : Luke Lozenski, Umberto Villa

> ABSTRACT  :  Dynamic imaging is essential for analyzing various biological systems and behaviors but faces two main challenges: data incompleteness and computational burden. For many imaging systems, high frame rates and short acquisition times require severe undersampling, which leads to data incompleteness. Multiple images may then be compatible with the data, thus requiring special techniques (regularization) to ensure the uniqueness of the reconstruction. Computational and memory requirements are particularly burdensome for three-dimensional dynamic imaging applications requiring high resolution in both space and time. Exploiting redundancies in the object's spatiotemporal features is key to addressing both challenges. This contribution investigates neural fields, or **implicit neural representation**s, to model the sought-after dynamic object. Neural fields are a particular class of neural networks that represent the dynamic object as a continuous function of space and time, thus avoiding the burden of storing a full resolution image at each time frame. Neural field representation thus reduces the image reconstruction problem to estimating the network parameters via a nonlinear optimization problem (training). Once trained, the neural field can be evaluated at arbitrary locations in space and time, allowing for high-resolution rendering of the object. Key advantages of the proposed approach are that neural fields automatically learn and exploit redundancies in the sought-after object to both regularize the reconstruction and significantly reduce memory storage requirements. The feasibility of the proposed framework is illustrated with an application to dynamic image reconstruction from severely undersampled circular Radon transform data.

### DeepFilterNet2: Towards Real-Time Speech **Enhancement** on Embedded Devices for Full-Band Audio. (arXiv:2205.05474v1 [eess.AS])
- Authors : Hendrik Schr, Tobias Rosenkranz, Andreas Maier
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05474](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05474)
> ABSTRACT  :  Deep learning-based speech **enhancement** has seen huge improvements and recently also expanded to full band audio (48 kHz). However, many approaches have a rather high computational complexity and require big temporal buffers for **real time** usage e.g. due to temporal convolutions or attention. Both make those approaches not feasible on embedded devices. This work further extends DeepFilterNet, which exploits harmonic structure of speech allowing for efficient speech **enhancement** (SE). Several optimizations in the training procedure, data augmentation, and network structure result in state-of-the-art SE performance while reducing the real-time factor to 0.04 on a notebook Core-i5 CPU. This makes the algorithm applicable to run on embedded devices in real-time. The DeepFilterNet framework can be obtained under an open source license.
