> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we propose a deformable convolution-based generative adversarial network (DCNGAN) for perceptual quality **enhancement** of compressed videos. DCNGAN is also adaptive to the quantization parameters (QPs). Compared with optical flows, deformable convolutions are more effective and efficient to align frames. Deformable convolutions can operate on multiple frames, thus leveraging more temporal information, which is beneficial for enhancing the perceptual quality of compressed videos. Instead of aligning frames in a pairwise manner, the deformable convolution can process multiple frames simultaneously, which leads to lower computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DCNGAN outperforms other state-of-the-art compressed video quality **enhancement** algorithms.

> ABSTRACT  :  In this article, we propose a simulated crowd counting dataset CrowdX, which has a large scale, accurate labeling, parameterized realization, and high fidelity. The experimental results of using this dataset as data **enhancement** show that the performance of the proposed streamlined and efficient benchmark network ESA-Net can be improved by 8.4\%. The other two classic heterogeneous architectures MCNN and CSRNet pre-trained on CrowdX also show significant performance improvements. Considering many influencing factors determine performance, such as background, camera angle, human density, and resolution. Although these factors are important, there is still a lack of research on how they affect crowd counting. Thanks to the CrowdX dataset with rich annotation information, we conduct a large number of data-driven comparative experiments to analyze these factors. Our research provides a reference for a deeper understanding of the crowd counting problem and puts forward some useful suggestions in the actual deployment of the algorithm.  
### Linear Array Network for Low-light Image **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2201.08996v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Convolution neural networks (CNNs) based methods have dominated the **low-light** image **enhancement** tasks due to their outstanding performance. However, the convolution operation is based on a local sliding window mechanism, which is difficult to construct the long-range dependencies of the feature maps. Meanwhile, the self-attention based global relationship aggregation methods have been widely used in computer vision, but these methods are difficult to handle high-resolution images because of the high computational complexity. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Linear Array Self-attention (LASA) mechanism, which uses only two 2-D feature encodings to construct 3-D global weights and then refines feature maps generated by convolution layers. Based on LASA, Linear Array Network (LAN) is proposed, which is superior to the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both RGB and RAW based **low-light** **enhancement** tasks with a smaller amount of parameters. The code is released in \url{https://github.com/cuiziteng/LASA_**enhancement**}.

> ABSTRACT  :  Priori knowledge of pulmonary anatomy plays a vital role in diagnosis of lung diseases. In CT images, pulmonary fissure segmentation is a formidable mission due to various of factors. To address the challenge, an useful approach based on ODoS filter and shape features is presented for pulmonary fissure segmentation. Here, we adopt an ODoS filter by merging the orientation information and magnitude information to highlight structure features for fissure **enhancement**, which can effectively distinguish between pulmonary fissures and clutters. Motivated by the fact that pulmonary fissures appear as linear structures in 2D space and planar structures in 3D space in orientation field, an orientation curvature criterion and an orientation partition scheme are fused to separate fissure patches and other structures in different orientation partition, which can suppress parts of clutters. Considering the shape difference between pulmonary fissures and tubular structures in magnitude field, a shape measure approach and a 3D skeletonization model are combined to segment pulmonary fissures for clutters removal. When applying our scheme to 55 chest CT scans which acquired from a publicly available LOLA11 datasets, the median F1-score, False Discovery Rate (FDR), and False Negative Rate (FNR) respectively are 0.896, 0.109, and 0.100, which indicates that the presented method has a satisfactory pulmonary fissure segmentation performance.

> ABSTRACT  :  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-radiative and non-invasive method for clinical interrogation of organ structures and metabolism, with an inherently long scanning time. Methods by k-space undersampling and deep learning based reconstruction have been popularised to accelerate the scanning process. This work focuses on investigating how powerful transformers are for fast MRI by exploiting and comparing different novel network architectures. In particular, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based **Swin** transformer (ST-GAN) was introduced for the fast MRI reconstruction. To further preserve the edge and texture information, edge enhanced GAN based **Swin** transformer (EESGAN) and texture enhanced GAN based **Swin** transformer (TES-GAN) were also developed, where a dual-discriminator GAN structure was applied. We compared our proposed GAN based transformers, standalone **Swin** transformer and other convolutional neural networks based based GAN model in terms of the evaluation metrics PSNR, SSIM and FID. We showed that transformers work well for the MRI reconstruction from different undersampling conditions. The utilisation of GAN's adversarial structure improves the quality of images reconstructed when undersampled for 30% or higher.  
### Progressive Image Super-Resolution via Neural Differential Equation. (arXiv:2101.08987v4 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  We propose a new approach for the image super-resolution (SR) task that progressively restores a high-resolution (HR) image from an input low-resolution (LR) image on the basis of a neural ordinary differential equation. In particular, we newly formulate the SR problem as an initial value problem, where the initial value is the input LR image. Unlike conventional progressive SR methods that perform gradual updates using straightforward iterative mechanisms, our SR process is formulated in a concrete manner based on explicit modeling with a much clearer understanding. Our method can be easily implemented using conventional neural networks for image **restoration**. Moreover, the proposed method can super-resolve an image with arbitrary scale factors on continuous domain, and achieves superior SR performance over state-of-the-art SR methods.

> ABSTRACT  :  Pedestrian Detection is the most critical module of an Autonomous Driving system. Although a camera is commonly used for this purpose, its quality degrades severely in **low-light** **night** time driving scenarios. On the other hand, the quality of a thermal camera image remains unaffected in similar conditions. This paper proposes an end-to-end multimodal fusion model for pedestrian detection using RGB and thermal images. Its novel spatio-contextual deep network architecture is capable of exploiting the multimodal input efficiently. It consists of two distinct deformable ResNeXt-50 encoders for feature extraction from the two modalities. Fusion of these two encoded features takes place inside a multimodal feature embedding module (MuFEm) consisting of several groups of a pair of Graph Attention Network and a feature fusion unit. The output of the last feature fusion unit of MuFEm is subsequently passed to two CRFs for their spatial refinement. Further **enhancement** of the features is achieved by applying channel-wise attention and extraction of contextual information with the help of four RNNs traversing in four different directions. Finally, these feature maps are used by a single-stage decoder to generate the bounding box of each pedestrian and the score map. We have performed extensive experiments of the proposed framework on three publicly available multimodal pedestrian detection benchmark datasets, namely KAIST, CVC-14, and UTokyo. The results on each of them improved the respective state-of-the-art performance. A short video giving an overview of this work along with its qualitative results can be seen at https://youtu.be/FDJdSifuuCs. Our source code will be released upon publication of the paper.  
### ERQA: Edge-**Restoration** Quality Assessment for Video Super-Resolution. (arXiv:2110.09992v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Despite the growing popularity of video super-resolution (VSR), there is still no good way to assess the quality of the restored details in upscaled frames. Some SR methods may produce the wrong digit or an entirely different face. Whether a method's results are trustworthy depends on how well it restores truthful details. Image super-resolution can use natural distributions to produce a high-resolution image that is only somewhat similar to the real one. VSR enables exploration of additional information in neighboring frames to restore details from the original scene. The ERQA metric, which we propose in this paper, aims to estimate a model's ability to restore real details using VSR. On the assumption that edges are significant for detail and character recognition, we chose edge fidelity as the foundation for this metric. Experimental validation of our work is based on the MSU Video Super-Resolution Benchmark, which includes the most difficult patterns for detail **restoration** and verifies the fidelity of details from the original frame. Code for the proposed metric is publicly available at https://github.com/msu-video-group/ERQA.

> ABSTRACT  :  Moving object detection and segmentation is an essential task in the Autonomous Driving pipeline. Detecting and isolating static and moving components of a vehicle's surroundings are particularly crucial in path planning and localization tasks. This paper proposes a novel real-time architecture for motion segmentation of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. We use three successive scans of LiDAR data in 2D Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation to perform pixel-wise classification as static or moving. Furthermore, we propose a novel data augmentation technique to reduce the significant class imbalance between static and moving objects. We achieve this by artificially synthesizing moving objects by cutting and pasting static vehicles. We demonstrate a low latency of 8 ms on a commonly used automotive embedded platform, namely Nvidia Jetson Xavier. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work directly performing motion segmentation in LiDAR BEV space. We provide quantitative results on the challenging SemanticKITTI dataset, and qualitative results are provided in https://youtu.be/2aJ-cL8b0LI.

> ABSTRACT  :  Linguistic knowledge has brought great benefits to scene text recognition by providing semantics to refine character sequences. However, since linguistic knowledge has been applied individually on the output sequence, previous methods have not fully utilized the semantics to understand visual clues for text recognition. This paper introduces a novel method, called Multi-modAl Text Recognition Network (MATRN), that enables interactions between visual and semantic features for better recognition performances. Specifically, MATRN identifies visual and semantic feature pairs and encodes spatial information into semantic features. Based on the spatial encoding, visual and semantic features are enhanced by referring to related features in the other modality. Furthermore, MATRN stimulates combining semantic features into visual features by hiding visual clues related to the character in the training phase. Our experiments demonstrate that MATRN achieves state-of-the-art performances on seven benchmarks with large margins, while naive combinations of two modalities show marginal improvements. Further ablative studies prove the effectiveness of our proposed components. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/wp03052/MATRN.

### Automated machine learning for secure key rate in discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution. (arXiv:2201.09419v1 [quant-ph])

> ABSTRACT  :  Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV QKD) with discrete modulation has attracted increasing attention due to its experimental simplicity, lower-cost implementation and compatibility with classical optical communication. Correspondingly, some novel numerical methods have been proposed to analyze the security of these protocols against collective attacks, which promotes key rates over one hundred kilometers of fiber distance. However, numerical methods are limited by their calculation time and resource consumption, for which they cannot play more roles on mobile platforms in quantum networks. To improve this issue, a neural network model predicting key rates in nearly **real time** has been proposed previously. Here, we go further and show a neural network model combined with Bayesian optimization. This model automatically designs the best architecture of neural network computing key rates in **real time**. We demonstrate our model with two variants of CV QKD protocols with quaternary modulation. The results show high reliability with secure probability as high as $99.15\%-99.59\%$, considerable tightness and high efficiency with speedup of approximately $10^7$ in both cases. This inspiring model enables the real-time computation of unstructured quantum key distribution protocols' key rate more automatically and efficiently, which has met the growing needs of implementing QKD protocols on moving platforms.

> ABSTRACT  :  Deep-learning based methods have shown their advantages inaudio coding over traditional ones but limited attention hasbeen paid on real-time communications (RTC). This paperproposes the TFNet, an end-to-end neural audio codec withlow latency for RTC. It takes an encoder-temporal filtering-decoder paradigm that seldom being investigated in audiocoding. An interleaved structure is proposed for temporalfiltering to capture both short-term and long-term temporaldependencies. Furthermore, with end-to-end optimization,the TFNet is jointly optimized with speech **enhancement** andpacket loss concealment, yielding a one-for-all network forthree tasks. Both subjective and objective results demonstratethe efficiency of the proposed TFNet.

> ABSTRACT  :  We propose a novel knowledge distillation approach to facilitate the transfer of **dark** knowledge from a teacher to a student. Contrary to most of the existing methods that rely on effective training of student models given pretrained teachers, we aim to learn the teacher models that are friendly to students and, consequently, more appropriate for knowledge transfer. In other words, at the time of optimizing a teacher model, the proposed algorithm learns the student branches jointly to obtain student-friendly representations. Since the main goal of our approach lies in training teacher models and the subsequent knowledge distillation procedure is straightforward, most of the existing knowledge distillation methods can adopt this technique to improve the performance of diverse student models in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. The proposed algorithm demonstrates outstanding accuracy in several well-known knowledge distillation techniques with various combinations of teacher and student models even in the case that their architectures are heterogeneous and there is no prior knowledge about student models at the time of training teacher networks.

> ABSTRACT  :  The incompleteness of speech inputs severely degrades the performance of all the related speech signal processing applications. Although many researches have been proposed to address this issue, they controlled the data missing conditions by simulation with self-defined masking lengths or sizes. Besides, the masking definitions are different among all these experimental settings. This paper presents a novel intermittent speech recovery (ISR) system for real-world self-powered intermittent devices. Three contributive stages: interpolation, **enhancement**, and combination are applied to the ISR system for speech reconstruction. The experimental results show that our recovery system increases speech quality by up to 591.7%, while increasing speech intelligibility by up to 80.5%. Most importantly, the proposed ISR system improves the WER scores by up to 52.6%. The promising results not only confirm the effectiveness of the reconstruction but also encourage the utilization of these battery-free wearable/IoT devices.  
### End-to-End Complex-Valued Multidilated Convolutional Neural Network for Joint Acoustic Echo Cancellation and Noise Suppression. (arXiv:2110.00745v3 [eess.AS] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00745](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00745)
> ABSTRACT  :  Echo and noise suppression is an integral part of a full-duplex communication system. Many recent acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) systems rely on a separate adaptive filtering module for linear echo suppression and a neural module for residual echo suppression. However, not only do adaptive filtering modules require convergence and remain susceptible to changes in acoustic environments, but this two-stage framework also often introduces unnecessary delays to the AEC system when neural modules are already capable of both linear and nonlinear echo suppression. In this paper, we exploit the offset-compensating ability of complex time-frequency masks and propose an end-to-end complex-valued neural network architecture. The building block of the proposed model is a pseudocomplex extension based on the densely-connected multidilated DenseNet (D3Net) building block, resulting in a very small network of only 354K parameters. The architecture utilized the multi-resolution nature of the D3Net building blocks to eliminate the need for pooling, allowing the network to extract features using large receptive fields without any loss of output resolution. We also propose a dual-mask technique for joint echo and noise suppression with simultaneous speech **enhancement**. Evaluation on both synthetic and real test sets demonstrated promising results across multiple energy-based metrics and perceptual proxies.

### Online Soft Conformance Checking: Any Perspective Can Indicate Deviations. (arXiv:2201.09222v1 [cs.AI])
- Authors : Andrea Burattin
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09222](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09222)
> ABSTRACT  :  Within process mining, a relevant activity is conformance checking. Such activity consists of establishing the extent to which actual executions of a process conform the expected behavior of a reference model. Current techniques focus on prescriptive models of the control-flow as references. In certain scenarios, however, a prescriptive model might not be available and, additionally, the control-flow perspective might not be ideal for this purpose. This paper tackles these two problems by suggesting a conformance approach that uses a descriptive model (i.e., a pattern of the observed behavior over a certain amount of time) which is not necessarily referring to the control-flow (e.g., it can be based on the social network of handover of work). Additionally, the entire approach can work both offline and online, thus providing feedback in **real time**. The approach, which is implemented in ProM, has been tested and results from 3 experiments with real world as well as synthetic data are reported.

The building block of the proposed model is a pseudocomplex extension based on the densely-connected multidilated DenseNet (D3Net) building block, resulting in a very small network of only 354K parameters. The architecture utilized the multi-resolution nature of the D3Net building blocks to eliminate the need for pooling, allowing the network to extract features using large receptive fields without any loss of output resolution. We also propose a dual-mask technique for joint echo and noise suppression with simultaneous speech **enhancement**. Evaluation on both synthetic and real test sets demonstrated promising results across multiple energy-based metrics and perceptual proxies.

> ABSTRACT  :  Curriculum learning begins to thrive in the speech **enhancement** area, which decouples the original spectrum estimation task into multiple easier sub-tasks to achieve better performance. Motivated by that, we propose a dual-branch attention-in-attention transformer dubbed DB-AIAT to handle both coarse- and fine-grained regions of the spectrum in parallel. From a complementary perspective, a magnitude masking branch is proposed to coarsely estimate the overall magnitude spectrum, and simultaneously a complex refining branch is elaborately designed to compensate for the missing spectral details and implicitly derive phase information. Within each branch, we propose a novel attention-in-attention transformer-based module to replace the conventional RNNs and temporal convolutional networks for temporal sequence modeling. Specifically, the proposed attention-in-attention transformer consists of adaptive temporal-frequency attention transformer blocks and an adaptive hierarchical attention module, aiming to capture long-term temporal-frequency dependencies and further aggregate global hierarchical contextual information. Experimental results on Voice Bank + DEMAND demonstrate that DB-AIAT yields state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 3.31 PESQ, 95.6% STOI and 10.79dB SSNR) over previous advanced systems with a relatively small model size (2.81M).

> ABSTRACT  :  Event cameras are a new type of sensors that are different from traditional cameras. Each pixel is triggered asynchronously by event. The trigger event is the change of the brightness irradiated on the pixel. If the increment or decrement of brightness is higher than a certain threshold, an event is output. Compared with traditional cameras, event cameras have the advantages of **high dynamic range** and no motion blur. Accumulating events to frames and using traditional SLAM algorithm is a direct and efficient way for event-based SLAM. Different event accumulator settings, such as slice method of event stream, processing method for no motion, using polarity or not, decay function and event contribution, can cause quite different accumulating results. We conducted the research on how to accumulate event frames to achieve a better event-based SLAM performance. For experiment verification, accumulated event frames are fed to the traditional SLAM system to construct an event-based SLAM system. Our strategy of setting event accumulator has been evaluated on the public dataset. The experiment results show that our method can achieve better performance in most sequences compared with the state-of-the-art event frame based SLAM algorithm. In addition, the proposed approach has been tested on a quadrotor UAV to show the potential of applications in real scenario. Code and results are open sourced to benefit the research community of event cameras.
