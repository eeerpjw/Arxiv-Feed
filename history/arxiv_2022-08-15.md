> ABSTRACT  :  To maintain a standard in a medical imaging study, images should have necessary image quality for potential diagnostic use. Although CNN-based approaches are used to assess the image quality, their performance can still be improved in terms of accuracy. In this work, we approach this problem by using **Swin** Transformer, which improves the poor-quality image classification performance that causes the degradation in medical image quality. We test our approach on Foreign Object Classification problem on Chest X-Rays (Object-CXR) and Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Classification problem on Cardiac MRI with a four-chamber view (LVOT). While we obtain a classification accuracy of 87.1% and 95.48% on the Object-CXR and LVOT datasets, our experimental results suggest that the use of **Swin** Transformer improves the Object-CXR classification performance while obtaining a comparable performance for the LVOT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first vision transformer application for medical image quality assessment.  
### 3D High-Quality Magnetic Resonance Image **Restoration** in Clinics Using Deep Learning. (arXiv:2111.14259v4 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Shortening acquisition time and reducing the motion artifacts are two of the most essential concerns in magnetic resonance imaging. As a promising solution, deep learning-based high-quality MR image **restoration** has been investigated to generate highly-resolved and motion artifact-free MR images from lower resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition time or motion artifact-corrupted images. However, numerous problems still exist to prevent deep learning approaches from becoming practical in the clinic environment. Specifically, most of the prior works focus solely on the network but ignore the impact of various down-sampling strategies on the acquisition time. Besides, the long inference time and high GPU consumption are also the bottlenecks to deploy most of the prior works in clinics. Furthermore, prior studies employ random movement in retrospective motion artifact generation, resulting in uncontrollable severity of motion artifact. More importantly, doctors are unsure whether the generated MR images are trustworthy, making diagnosis difficult. To overcome all these problems, we adopted a unified framework of 2D deep learning neural network for both 3D MRI super-resolution and motion artifact reduction, demonstrating such a framework can achieve better performance in 3D MRI **restoration** tasks compared to other state-of-the-art methods and remain the GPU consumption and inference time significantly low, thus easier to deploy. We also analyzed several down-sampling strategies based on the acceleration factor, including multiple combinations of in-plane and through-plane down-sampling, and developed a controllable and quantifiable motion artifact generation method. At last, the pixel-wise uncertainty was calculated and used to estimate the accuracy of the generated image, providing additional information for a reliable diagnosis.

> ABSTRACT  :  Despite the rapid development of Neural Radiance Field (**NeRF**), the necessity of dense covers largely prohibits its wider applications. While several recent works have attempted to address this issue, they either operate with sparse views (yet still, a few of them) or on simple objects/scenes. In this work, we consider a more ambitious task: training neural radiance field, over realistically complex visual scenes, by "looking only once", i.e., using only a single view. To attain this goal, we present a Single View **NeRF** (Sin**NeRF**) framework consisting of thoughtfully designed semantic and geometry regularizations. Specifically, Sin**NeRF** constructs a semi-supervised learning process, where we introduce and propagate geometry pseudo labels and semantic pseudo labels to guide the progressive training process. Extensive experiments are conducted on complex scene benchmarks, including **NeRF** synthetic dataset, Local Light Field Fusion dataset, and DTU dataset. We show that even without pre-training on multi-view datasets, Sin**NeRF** can yield photo-realistic novel-view synthesis results. Under the single image setting, Sin**NeRF** significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art **NeRF** baselines in all cases. Project page: https://vita-group.github.io/Sin**NeRF**/
