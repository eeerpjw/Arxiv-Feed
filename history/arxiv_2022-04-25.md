> ABSTRACT  :  We introduce an interactive image segmentation and visualization framework for identifying, inspecting, and editing tiny objects (just a few pixels wide) in large multi-megapixel high-dynamic-range (**HDR**) images. Detecting cosmic rays (CRs) in astronomical observations is a cumbersome workflow that requires multiple tools, so we developed an interactive toolkit that unifies model inference, **HDR** image visualization, segmentation mask inspection and editing into a single graphical user interface. The feature set, initially designed for astronomical data, makes this work a useful research-supporting tool for human-in-the-loop tiny-object segmentation in scientific areas like biomedicine, materials science, remote sensing, etc., as well as computer vision. Our interface features mouse-controlled, synchronized, dual-window visualization of the image and the segmentation mask, a critical feature for locating tiny objects in multi-megapixel images. The browser-based tool can be readily hosted on the web to provide multi-user access and GPU acceleration for any device. The toolkit can also be used as a high-precision annotation tool, or adapted as the frontend for an interactive machine learning framework. Our open-source dataset, CR detection model, and visualization toolkit are available at https://github.com/cy-xu/cosmic-conn.

> ABSTRACT  :  Object detection is an essential component of many vision systems. For example, pedestrian detection is used in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and advanced video surveillance systems (AVSS). Currently, most detectors use deep convolutional neural networks (e.g., the YOLO -- You Only Look Once -- family), which, however, due to their high computational complexity, are not able to process a very high-resolution video stream in real-time, especially within a limited energy budget. In this paper we present a hardware implementation of the well-known pedestrian detector with HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) feature extraction and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification. Our system running on AMD Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC (Multiprocessor System on Chip) device allows real-time processing of 4K resolution (UHD -- Ultra High Definition, 3840 x 2160 pixels) video for 60 frames per second. The system is capable of detecting a pedestrian in a single scale. The results obtained confirm the high suitability of reprogrammable devices in the real-time implementation of embedded vision systems.

> ABSTRACT  :  **Exposure** errors in an image cause a degradation in the contrast and low visibility in the content. In this paper, we address this problem and propose an end-to-end **exposure** correction model in order to handle both under- and over**exposure** errors with a single model. Our model contains an image encoder, consecutive residual blocks, and image decoder to synthesize the corrected image. We utilize perceptual loss, feature matching loss, and multi-scale discriminator to increase the quality of the generated image as well as to make the training more stable. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of proposed model. We achieve the state-of-the-art result on a large-scale **exposure** dataset. Besides, we investigate the effect of **exposure** setting of the image on the portrait matting task. We find that under- and overexposed images cause severe degradation in the performance of the portrait matting models. We show that after applying **exposure** correction with the proposed model, the portrait matting quality increases significantly. https://github.com/yamand16/**Exposure**Correction  
### Control-**NeRF**: Editable Feature Volumes for Scene Rendering and Manipulation. (arXiv:2204.10850v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  We present a novel method for performing flexible, 3D-aware image content manipulation while enabling high-quality novel view synthesis. While **NeRF**-based approaches are effective for novel view synthesis, such models memorize the radiance for every point in a scene within a neural network. Since these models are scene-specific and lack a 3D scene representation, classical editing such as shape manipulation, or combining scenes is not possible. Hence, editing and combining **NeRF**-based scenes has not been demonstrated. With the aim of obtaining interpretable and controllable scene representations, our model couples learnt scene-specific feature volumes with a scene agnostic neural rendering network. With this hybrid representation, we decouple neural rendering from scene-specific geometry and appearance. We can generalize to novel scenes by optimizing only the scene-specific 3D feature representation, while keeping the parameters of the rendering network fixed. The rendering function learnt during the initial training stage can thus be easily applied to new scenes, making our approach more flexible. More importantly, since the feature volumes are independent of the rendering model, we can manipulate and combine scenes by editing their corresponding feature volumes. The edited volume can then be plugged into the rendering model to synthesize high-quality novel views. We demonstrate various scene manipulations, including mixing scenes, deforming objects and inserting objects into scenes, while still producing photo-realistic results.  
### MSDN: Mutually Semantic Distillation Network for Zero-Shot Learning. (arXiv:2203.03137v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  The key challenge of zero-shot learning (ZSL) is how to infer the latent semantic knowledge between visual and attribute features on seen classes, and thus achieving a desirable knowledge transfer to unseen classes. Prior works either simply align the global features of an image with its associated class semantic vector or utilize unidirectional attention to learn the limited latent semantic representations, which could not effectively discover the intrinsic semantic knowledge e.g., attribute semantics) between visual and attribute features. To solve the above dilemma, we propose a Mutually Semantic Distillation Network (MSDN), which progressively distills the intrinsic semantic representations between visual and attribute features for ZSL. MSDN incorporates an attribute$\rightarrow$visual attention sub-net that learns attribute-based visual features, and a visual$\rightarrow$attribute attention sub-net that learns visual-based attribute features. By further introducing a semantic distillation loss, the two mutual attention sub-nets are capable of learning collaboratively and teaching each other throughout the training process. The proposed MSDN yields significant improvements over the strong baselines, leading to new state-of-the-art performances on three popular challenging benchmarks, i.e., CUB, SUN, and AWA2. Our codes have been available at: \url{https://github.com/shiming-chen/MSDN}.

> ABSTRACT  :  Text-Video Retrieval plays an important role in multi-modal understanding and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Most existing methods focus on constructing contrastive pairs between whole videos and complete caption sentences, while ignoring fine-grained cross-modal relationships, e.g., short clips and phrases or single frame and word. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named HunYuan\_tvr, to explore hierarchical cross-modal interactions by simultaneously exploring video-sentence, clip-phrase, and frame-word relationships. Considering intrinsic semantic relations between frames, HunYuan\_tvr first performs self-attention to explore frame-wise correlations and adaptively clusters correlated frames into clip-level representations. Then, the clip-wise correlation is explored to aggregate clip representations into a compact one to describe the video globally. In this way, we can construct hierarchical video representations for frame-clip-video granularities, and also explore word-wise correlations to form word-phrase-sentence embeddings for the text modality. Finally, hierarchical contrastive learning is designed to explore cross-modal relationships,~\emph{i.e.,} frame-word, clip-phrase, and video-sentence, which enables HunYuan\_tvr to achieve a comprehensive multi-modal understanding. Further boosted by adaptive label denosing and marginal sample **enhancement**, HunYuan\_tvr obtains new state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, e.g., Rank@1 of 55.0%, 57.8%, 29.7%, 52.1%, and 57.3% on MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, DiDemo, and ActivityNet respectively.  
### Efficient Linear Attention for Fast and Accurate Keypoint Matching. (arXiv:2204.07731v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Recently Transformers have provided state-of-the-art performance in sparse matching, crucial to realize high-performance 3D vision applications. Yet, these Transformers lack efficiency due to the quadratic computational complexity of their attention mechanism. To solve this problem, we employ an efficient linear attention for the linear computational complexity. Then, we propose a new attentional aggregation that achieves high accuracy by aggregating both the global and local information from sparse keypoints. To further improve the efficiency, we propose the joint learning of feature matching and description. Our learning enables simpler and faster matching than Sinkhorn, often used in matching the learned descriptors from Transformers. Our method achieves competitive performance with only 0.84M learnable parameters against the bigger SOTAs, SuperGlue (12M parameters) and SGMNet (30M parameters), on three benchmarks, HPatch, ETH, and Aachen Day-**Night**.  
### BSRT: Improving Burst Super-Resolution with **Swin** Transformer and Flow-Guided Deformable Alignment. (arXiv:2204.08332v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  This work addresses the Burst Super-Resolution (BurstSR) task using a new architecture, which requires restoring a high-quality image from a sequence of noisy, misaligned, and low-resolution RAW bursts. To overcome the challenges in BurstSR, we propose a Burst Super-Resolution Transformer (BSRT), which can significantly improve the capability of extracting inter-frame information and reconstruction. To achieve this goal, we propose a Pyramid Flow-Guided Deformable Convolution Network (Pyramid FG-DCN) and incorporate **Swin** Transformer Blocks and Groups as our main backbone. More specifically, we combine optical flows and deformable convolutions, hence our BSRT can handle misalignment and aggregate the potential texture information in multi-frames more efficiently. In addition, our Transformer-based structure can capture long-range dependency to further improve the performance. The evaluation on both synthetic and real-world tracks demonstrates that our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art in BurstSR task. Further, our BSRT wins the championship in the NTIRE2022 Burst Super-Resolution Challenge.

### SINR: Deconvolving Circular SAS Images Using Implicit Neural Representations. (arXiv:2204.10428v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors : Albert Reed, Thomas Blanford, Suren Jayasuriya
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10428](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10428)
> ABSTRACT  :  Circular Synthetic aperture sonars (CSAS) capture multiple observations of a scene to reconstruct high-resolution images. We can characterize resolution by modeling CSAS imaging as the convolution between a scene's underlying point scattering distribution and a system-dependent point spread function (PSF). The PSF is a function of the transmitted waveform's bandwidth and determines a fixed degree of blurring on reconstructed imagery. In theory, deconvolution overcomes bandwidth limitations by reversing the PSF-induced blur and recovering the scene's scattering distribution. However, deconvolution is an ill-posed inverse problem and sensitive to noise. We propose a self-supervised pipeline (does not require training data) that leverages an **implicit neural representation** (INR) for deconvolving CSAS images. We highlight the performance of our SAS INR pipeline, which we call SINR, by implementing and comparing to existing deconvolution methods. Additionally, prior SAS deconvolution methods assume a spatially-invariant PSF, which we demonstrate yields subpar performance in practice. We provide theory and methods to account for a spatially-varying CSAS PSF, and demonstrate that doing so enables SINR to achieve superior deconvolution performance on simulated and real acoustic SAS data. We provide code to encourage reproducibility of research.

### MCMC-driven importance samplers. (arXiv:2105.02579v4 [stat.CO] UPDATED)
- Authors : 
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02579](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02579)
> ABSTRACT  :  Monte Carlo sampling methods are the standard procedure for approximating complicated integrals of multidimensional posterior distributions in Bayesian inference. In this work, we focus on the class of Layered Adaptive Importance Sampling (LAIS) scheme, which is a family of adaptive importance samplers where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are employed to drive an underlying multiple importance sampling scheme. The modular nature of LAIS allows for different possible implementations, yielding a variety of different performance and computational costs. In this work, we propose different **enhancement**s of the classical LAIS setting in order to increase the efficiency and reduce the computational cost, of both upper and lower layers. The different variants address computational challenges arising in real-world applications, for instance with highly concentrated posterior distributions. Furthermore, we introduce different strategies for designing cheaper schemes, for instance, recycling samples generated in the upper layer and using them in the final estimators in the lower layer. Different numerical experiments, considering several challenging scenarios, show the benefits of the proposed schemes comparing with benchmark methods presented in the literature.  
### Super-resolving **Dark** Matter Halos using Generative Deep Learning. (arXiv:2111.06393v2 [astro-ph.CO] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Generative deep learning methods built upon Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) provide a great tool for predicting non-linear structure in cosmology. In this work we predict high resolution **dark** matter halos from large scale, low resolution **dark** matter only simulations. This is achieved by mapping lower resolution to higher resolution density fields of simulations sharing the same cosmology, initial conditions and box-sizes. To resolve structure down to a factor of 8 increase in mass resolution, we use a variation of U-Net with a conditional GAN, generating output that visually and statistically matches the high resolution target extremely well. This suggests that our method can be used to create high resolution density output over Gpc/h box-sizes from low resolution simulations with negligible computational effort.

### SalesBot: Transitioning from Chit-Chat to Task-Oriented Dialogues. (arXiv:2204.10591v1 [cs.CL])
- Authors : Ssu Chiu, Maolin Li, Ting Lin, Nung Chen
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10591](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10591)
> ABSTRACT  :  Dialogue systems are usually categorized into two types, open-domain and task-oriented. The first one focuses on chatting with users and making them engage in the conversations, where selecting a proper topic to fit the dialogue context is essential for a successful dialogue. The other one focuses on a specific task instead of casual talks, e.g., finding a movie on Friday **night**, or playing a song. These two directions have been studied separately due to their different purposes. However, how smoothly transitioning from social chatting to task-oriented dialogues is important for triggering business opportunities, and there is no public data focusing on such scenarios. Hence, this paper focuses on investigating the conversations starting from open-domain social chatting and then gradually transitioning to task-oriented purposes, and releases a large-scale dataset with detailed annotations for encouraging this research direction. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a framework to automatically generate many dialogues without human involvement, in which any powerful open-domain dialogue generation model can be easily leveraged. The human evaluation shows that our generated dialogue data has a natural flow at a reasonable quality, showing that our released data has a great potential of guiding future research directions and commercial activities. Furthermore, the released models allow researchers to automatically generate unlimited dialogues in the target scenarios, which can greatly benefit semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches.  
### Embracing AWKWARD! **Real-time** Adjustment of Reactive Planning Using Social Norms. (arXiv:2204.10740v1 [cs.MA])
- Authors : Leila Methnani, Andreas Antoniades, Andreas Theodorou
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10740](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10740)
> ABSTRACT  :  This paper presents the AWKWARD agent architecture for the development of agents in Multi-Agent Systems. AWKWARD agents can have their plans re-configured in **real time** to align with social role requirements under changing environmental and social circumstances. The proposed hybrid architecture makes use of Behaviour Oriented Design (BOD) to develop agents with reactive planning and of the well-established OperA framework to provide organisational, social, and interaction definitions in order to validate and adjust agents' behaviours. Together, OperA and BOD can achieve real-time adjustment of agent plans for evolving social roles, while providing the additional benefit of transparency into the interactions that drive this behavioural change in individual agents. We present this architecture to motivate the bridging between traditional symbolic- and behaviour-based AI communities, where such combined solutions can help MAS researchers in their pursuit of building stronger, more robust intelligent agent teams. We use DOTA2 -- a game where success is heavily dependent on social interactions -- as a medium to demonstrate a sample implementation of our proposed hybrid architecture
