### RemixIT: Continual self-training of speech **enhancement** models via bootstrapped remixing. (arXiv:2202.08862v1 [cs.SD])

> ABSTRACT  :  We present RemixIT, a simple yet effective selfsupervised method for training speech **enhancement** without the need of a single isolated in-domain speech nor a noise waveform. Our approach overcomes limitations of previous methods which make them dependent to clean in-domain target signals and thus, sensitive to any domain mismatch between train and test samples. RemixIT is based on a continuous self-training scheme in which a pre-trained teacher model on out-of-domain data infers estimated pseudo-target signals for in-domain mixtures. Then, by permuting the estimated clean and noise signals and remixing them together, we generate a new set of bootstrapped mixtures and corresponding pseudo-targets which are used to train the student network. Vice-versa, the teacher periodically refines its estimates using the updated parameters of the latest student models. Experimental results on multiple speech **enhancement** datasets and tasks not only show the superiority of our method over prior approaches but also showcase that RemixIT can be combined with any separation model as well as be applied towards any semi-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation task. Our analysis, paired with empirical evidence, sheds light on the inside functioning of our self-training scheme wherein the student model keeps obtaining better performance while observing severely degraded pseudo-targets.

> ABSTRACT  :  Despite multiple efforts made towards robust machine learning (ML) models, their vulnerability to adversarial examples remains a challenging problem that calls for rethinking the defense strategy. In this paper, we take a step back and investigate the causes behind ML models' susceptibility to adversarial examples. In particular, we focus on exploring the cause-effect link between adversarial examples and the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. To that end, we propose an OOD generalization method that stands against both adversary-induced and natural distribution shifts. Through an OOD to in-distribution mapping intuition, our approach translates OOD inputs to the data distribution used to train and test the model. Through extensive experiments on three benchmark image datasets of different scales (MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet) and by leveraging image-to-image translation methods, we confirm that the adversarial examples problem is a special case of the wider OOD generalization problem. Across all datasets, we show that our translation-based approach consistently improves robustness to OOD adversarial inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art defenses by a significant margin, while preserving the exact accuracy on benign (in-distribution) data. Furthermore, our method generalizes on naturally OOD inputs such as **dark**er or sharper images

> ABSTRACT  :  This paper describes the Royalflush speaker diarization system submitted to the Multi-channel Multi-party Meeting Transcription Challenge(M2MeT). Our system comprises speech **enhancement**, overlapped speech detection, speaker embedding extraction, speaker clustering, speech separation and system fusion. In this system, we made three contributions. First, we propose an architecture of combining the multi-channel and U-Net-based models, aiming at utilizing the benefits of these two individual architectures, for far-field overlapped speech detection. Second, in order to use overlapped speech detection model to help speaker diarization, a speech separation based overlapped speech handling approach, in which the speaker verification technique is further applied, is proposed. Third, we explore three speaker embedding methods, and obtained the state-of-the-art performance on the CNCeleb-E test set. With these proposals, our best individual system significantly reduces DER from 15.25% to 6.40%, and the fusion of four systems finally achieves a DER of 6.30% on the far-field Alimeeting evaluation set.
