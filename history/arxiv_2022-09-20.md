> ABSTRACT  :  Deep-learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) **restoration** methods have gained great popularity for their remarkable performance but often demand expensive network retraining whenever the specifics of task changes. In this paper, we propose to restore HSIs in a unified approach with an effective plug-and-play method, which can jointly retain the flexibility of optimization-based methods and utilize the powerful representation capability of deep neural networks. Specifically, we first develop a new deep HSI denoiser leveraging gated recurrent convolution units, short- and long-term skip connections, and an augmented noise level map to better exploit the abundant spatio-spectral information within HSIs. It, therefore, leads to the state-of-the-art performance on HSI denoising under both Gaussian and complex noise settings. Then, the proposed denoiser is inserted into the plug-and-play framework as a powerful implicit HSI prior to tackle various HSI **restoration** tasks. Through extensive experiments on HSI super-resolution, compressed sensing, and inpainting, we demonstrate that our approach often achieves superior performance, which is competitive with or even better than the state-of-the-art on each task, via a single model without any task-specific training.

> ABSTRACT  :  Moving Object Detection (MOD) is a critical vision task for successfully achieving safe autonomous driving. Despite plausible results of deep learning methods, most existing approaches are only frame-based and may fail to reach reasonable performance when dealing with dynamic traffic participants. Recent advances in sensor technologies, especially the Event camera, can naturally complement the conventional camera approach to better model moving objects. However, event-based works often adopt a pre-defined time window for event representation, and simply integrate it to estimate image intensities from events, neglecting much of the rich temporal information from the available asynchronous events. Therefore, from a new perspective, we propose RENet, a novel RGB-Event fusion Network, that jointly exploits the two complementary modalities to achieve more robust MOD under challenging scenarios for autonomous driving. Specifically, we first design a temporal multi-scale aggregation module to fully leverage event frames from both the RGB **exposure** time and larger intervals. Then we introduce a bi-directional fusion module to attentively calibrate and fuse multi-modal features. To evaluate the performance of our network, we carefully select and annotate a sub-MOD dataset from the commonly used DSEC dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art RGB-Event fusion alternatives.

> ABSTRACT  :  Benefiting from the vigorous development of deep learning, many CNN-based image super-resolution methods have emerged and achieved better results than traditional algorithms. However, it is difficult for most algorithms to adaptively adjust the spatial region and channel features at the same time, let alone the information exchange between them. In addition, the exchange of information between attention modules is even less visible to researchers. To solve these problems, we put forward a lightweight spatial-channel adaptive coordination of multilevel refinement **enhancement** networks(MREN). Specifically, we construct a space-channel adaptive coordination block, which enables the network to learn the spatial region and channel feature information of interest under different receptive fields. In addition, the information of the corresponding feature processing level between the spatial part and the channel part is exchanged with the help of jump connection to achieve the coordination between the two. We establish a communication bridge between attention modules through a simple linear combination operation, so as to more accurately and continuously guide the network to pay attention to the information of interest. Extensive experiments on several standard test sets have shown that our MREN achieves superior performance over other advanced algorithms with a very small number of parameters and very low computational complexity.

> ABSTRACT  :  Developing and integrating advanced image sensors with novel algorithms in camera systems are prevalent with the increasing demand for computational photography and imaging on mobile platforms. However, the lack of high-quality data for research and the rare opportunity for in-depth exchange of views from industry and academia constrain the development of mobile intelligent photography and imaging (MIPI). To bridge the gap, we introduce the first MIPI challenge including five tracks focusing on novel image sensors and imaging algorithms. In this paper, RGBW Joint Remosaic and Denoise, one of the five tracks, working on the interpolation of RGBW CFA to Bayer at full resolution, is introduced. The participants were provided with a new dataset including 70 (training) and 15 (validation) scenes of high-quality RGBW and Bayer pairs. In addition, for each scene, RGBW of different noise levels was provided at 0dB, 24dB, and 42dB. All the data were captured using an RGBW sensor in both outdoor and indoor conditions. The final results are evaluated using objective metrics including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and KLD. A detailed description of all models developed in this challenge is provided in this paper. More details of this challenge and the link to the dataset can be found at https://github.com/mipi-challenge/MIPI2022.

> ABSTRACT  :  Recent efforts of multimodal Transformers have improved Visually Rich Document Understanding (VrDU) tasks via incorporating visual and textual information. However, existing approaches mainly focus on fine-grained elements such as words and document image patches, making it hard for them to learn from coarse-grained elements, including natural lexical units like phrases and salient visual regions like prominent image regions. In this paper, we attach more importance to coarse-grained elements containing high-density information and consistent semantics, which are valuable for document understanding. At first, a document graph is proposed to model complex relationships among multi-grained multimodal elements, in which salient visual regions are detected by a cluster-based method. Then, a multi-grained multimodal Transformer called mmLayout is proposed to incorporate coarse-grained information into existing pre-trained fine-grained multimodal Transformers based on the graph. In mmLayout, coarse-grained information is aggregated from fine-grained, and then, after further processing, is fused back into fine-grained for final prediction. Furthermore, common sense **enhancement** is introduced to exploit the semantic information of natural lexical units. Experimental results on four tasks, including information extraction and document question answering, show that our method can improve the performance of multimodal Transformers based on fine-grained elements and achieve better performance with fewer parameters. Qualitative analyses show that our method can capture consistent semantics in coarse-grained elements.  
### Low-Rank Tensor Completion Based on Bivariate Equivalent Minimax-Concave Penalty. (arXiv:2201.12709v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) is an important problem in computer vision and machine learning. The minimax-concave penalty (MCP) function as a non-convex relaxation has achieved good results in the LRTC problem. To makes all the constant parameters of the MCP function as variables so that futherly improving the adaptability to the change of singular values in the LRTC problem, we propose the bivariate equivalent minimax-concave penalty (BEMCP) theorem. Applying the BEMCP theorem to tensor singular values leads to the bivariate equivalent weighted tensor $\Gamma$-norm (BEWTGN) theorem, and we analyze and discuss its corresponding properties. Besides, to facilitate the solution of the LRTC problem, we give the proximal operators of the BEMCP theorem and BEWTGN. Meanwhile, we propose a BEMCP model for the LRTC problem, which is optimally solved based on alternating direction multiplier (ADMM). Finally, the proposed method is applied to the data **restoration**s of multispectral image (MSI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and color video (CV) in real-world, and the experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-arts methods.

> ABSTRACT  :  Few-shot object detection (FSOD) has thrived in recent years to learn novel object classes with limited data by transferring knowledge gained on abundant base classes. FSOD approaches commonly assume that both the scarcely provided examples of novel classes and test-time data belong to the same domain. However, this assumption does not hold in various industrial and robotics applications, where a model can learn novel classes from a source domain while inferring on classes from a target domain. In this work, we address the task of zero-shot domain adaptation, also known as domain generalization, for FSOD. Specifically, we assume that neither images nor labels of the novel classes in the target domain are available during training. Our approach for solving the domain gap is two-fold. First, we leverage a meta-training paradigm, where we learn the domain shift on the base classes, then transfer the domain knowledge to the novel classes. Second, we propose various data augmentations techniques on the few shots of novel classes to account for all possible domain-specific information. To constraint the network into encoding domain-agnostic class-specific representations only, a contrastive loss is proposed to maximize the mutual information between foreground proposals and class embeddings and reduce the network's bias to the background information from target domain. Our experiments on the T-LESS, PASCAL-VOC, and Ex**Dark** datasets show that the proposed approach succeeds in alleviating the domain gap considerably without utilizing labels or images of novel categories from the target domain.  
### Unsupervised **Night** Image **Enhancement**: When Layer Decomposition Meets Light-Effects Suppression. (arXiv:2207.10564v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Yeying Jin, **Wenhan Yang**
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10564](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10564)
> ABSTRACT  :  **Night** images suffer not only from **low light**, but also from uneven distributions of light. Most existing **night** visibility **enhancement** methods focus mainly on enhancing **low-light** regions. This inevitably leads to over **enhancement** and saturation in bright regions, such as those regions affected by light effects (glare, floodlight, etc). To address this problem, we need to suppress the light effects in bright regions while, at the same time, boosting the intensity of **dark** regions. With this idea in mind, we introduce an unsupervised method that integrates a layer decomposition network and a light-effects suppression network. Given a single **night** image as input, our decomposition network learns to decompose shading, reflectance and light-effects layers, guided by unsupervised layer-specific prior losses. Our light-effects suppression network further suppresses the light effects and, at the same time, enhances the illumination in **dark** regions. This light-effects suppression network exploits the estimated light-effects layer as the guidance to focus on the light-effects regions. To recover the background details and reduce hallucination/artefacts, we propose structure and high-frequency consistency losses. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real images show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in suppressing **night** light effects and boosting the intensity of **dark** regions.  
### Towards self-attention based visual navigation in the real world. (arXiv:2209.07043v2 [cs.RO] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Vision guided navigation requires processing complex visual information to inform task-orientated decisions. Applications include autonomous robots, self-driving cars, and assistive vision for humans. A key element is the extraction and selection of relevant features in pixel space upon which to base action choices, for which Machine Learning techniques are well suited. However, Deep Reinforcement Learning agents trained in simulation often exhibit unsatisfactory results when deployed in the real-world due to perceptual differences known as the $\textit{reality gap}$. An approach that is yet to be explored to bridge this gap is self-attention. In this paper we (1) perform a systematic exploration of the hyperparameter space for self-attention based navigation of 3D environments and qualitatively appraise behaviour observed from different hyperparameter sets, including their ability to generalise; (2) present strategies to improve the agents' generalisation abilities and navigation behaviour; and (3) show how models trained in simulation are capable of processing real world images meaningfully in **real time**. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a self-attention based agent successfully trained in navigating a 3D action space, using less than 4000 parameters.  
### Self-Attentive Pooling for Efficient Deep Learning. (arXiv:2209.07659v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Efficient custom pooling techniques that can aggressively trim the dimensions of a feature map and thereby reduce inference compute and memory footprint for resource-constrained computer vision applications have recently gained significant traction. However, prior pooling works extract only the local context of the activation maps, limiting their effectiveness. In contrast, we propose a novel non-local self-attentive pooling method that can be used as a drop-in replacement to the standard pooling layers, such as max/average pooling or strided convolution. The proposed self-attention module uses patch embedding, multi-head self-attention, and spatial-channel **restoration**, followed by sigmoid activation and exponential soft-max. This self-attention mechanism efficiently aggregates dependencies between non-local activation patches during down-sampling. Extensive experiments on standard object classification and detection tasks with various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures demonstrate the superiority of our proposed mechanism over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) pooling techniques. In particular, we surpass the test accuracy of existing pooling techniques on different variants of MobileNet-V2 on ImageNet by an average of 1.2%. With the aggressive down-sampling of the activation maps in the initial layers (providing up to 22x reduction in memory consumption), our approach achieves 1.43% higher test accuracy compared to SOTA techniques with iso-memory footprints. This enables the deployment of our models in memory-constrained devices, such as micro-controllers (without losing significant accuracy), because the initial activation maps consume a significant amount of on-chip memory for high-resolution images required for complex vision tasks. Our proposed pooling method also leverages the idea of channel pruning to further reduce memory footprints.

### Masked Face Inpainting Through Residual Attention UNet. (arXiv:2209.08850v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Md Imran, Md Baharul
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08850](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08850)
> ABSTRACT  :  Realistic image **restoration** with high texture areas such as removing face masks is challenging. The state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods fail to guarantee high-fidelity, cause training instability due to vanishing gradient problems (e.g., weights are updated slightly in initial layers) and spatial information loss. They also depend on intermediary stage such as segmentation meaning require external mask. This paper proposes a blind mask face inpainting method using residual attention UNet to remove the face mask and restore the face with fine details while minimizing the gap with the ground truth face structure. A residual block feeds info to the next layer and directly into the layers about two hops away to solve the gradient vanishing problem. Besides, the attention unit helps the model focus on the relevant mask region, reducing resources and making the model faster. Extensive experiments on the publicly available CelebA dataset show the feasibility and robustness of our proposed model. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/mdhosen/Mask-Face-Inpainting-Using-Residual-Attention-Unet}

> ABSTRACT  :  When using constellation synergy to image large areas for reconnaissance, it is required to achieve the coverage capability requirements with minimal consumption of observation resources to obtain the most optimal constellation observation scheme. With the minimum number of satellites and meeting the real-time ground coverage requirements as the optimization objectives, this paper proposes an optimized design of satellite constellation configuration for full coverage of large-scale regional imaging by using an improved simulated annealing algorithm combined with the real-time coverage evaluation method of hexagonal discretization. The algorithm can adapt to experimental conditions, has good efficiency, and can meet industrial accuracy requirements. The effectiveness and adaptability of the algorithm are tested in simulation applications.

### **Real-time** Outdoor Localization Using Radio Maps: A Deep Learning Approach. (arXiv:2106.12556v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)
- Authors : kan Yapar, Ron Levie, Gitta Kutyniok, Giuseppe Caire
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12556](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12556)
> ABSTRACT  :  Global Navigation Satellite Systems typically perform poorly in urban environments, where the likelihood of line-of-sight conditions between the devices and the satellites is low, and thus alternative localization methods are required for good accuracy. We present LocUNet: A convolutional, end-to-end trained neural network for the localization task, able to estimate the position of a user from the received signal strength (RSS) from a small number of Base Stations (BSs). In the proposed method, the user to be localized simply reports the measured RSS to a central processing unit, which may be located in the cloud. Using estimations of pathloss radio maps of the BSs and the RSS measurements, LocUNet can localize users with state-of-the-art accuracy and enjoys high robustness to inaccuracies in the estimations of radio maps. The proposed method does not require pre-sampling of new environments and is suitable for real-time applications. Moreover, two novel datasets that allow for numerical evaluations of RSS and ToA methods in realistic urban environments are presented and made publicly available for the research community. By using these datasets, we also provide a fair comparison of state-of-the-art RSS and ToA-based methods in the dense urban scenario and show numerically that LocUNet outperforms all the compared methods.  
### Class-Incremental Continual Learning into the eXtended DER-verse. (arXiv:2201.00766v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  The staple of human intelligence is the capability of acquiring knowledge in a continuous fashion. In stark contrast, Deep Networks forget catastrophically and, for this reason, the sub-field of Class-Incremental Continual Learning fosters methods that learn a sequence of tasks incrementally, blending sequentially-gained knowledge into a comprehensive prediction.    This work aims at assessing and overcoming the pitfalls of our previous proposal **Dark** Experience Replay (DER), a simple and effective approach that combines rehearsal and Knowledge Distillation. Inspired by the way our minds constantly rewrite past recollections and set expectations for the future, we endow our model with the abilities to i) revise its replay memory to welcome novel information regarding past data ii) pave the way for learning yet unseen classes.    We show that the application of these strategies leads to remarkable improvements; indeed, the resulting method - termed eXtended-DER (X-DER) - outperforms the state of the art on both standard benchmarks (such as CIFAR-100 and miniImagenet) and a novel one here introduced. To gain a better understanding, we further provide extensive ablation studies that corroborate and extend the findings of our previous research (e.g. the value of Knowledge Distillation and flatter minima in continual learning setups).  
### Low-Rank Tensor Completion Based on Bivariate Equivalent Minimax-Concave Penalty. (arXiv:2201.12709v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) is an important problem in computer vision and machine learning. The minimax-concave penalty (MCP) function as a non-convex relaxation has achieved good results in the LRTC problem. To makes all the constant parameters of the MCP function as variables so that futherly improving the adaptability to the change of singular values in the LRTC problem, we propose the bivariate equivalent minimax-concave penalty (BEMCP) theorem. Applying the BEMCP theorem to tensor singular values leads to the bivariate equivalent weighted tensor $\Gamma$-norm (BEWTGN) theorem, and we analyze and discuss its corresponding properties. Besides, to facilitate the solution of the LRTC problem, we give the proximal operators of the BEMCP theorem and BEWTGN. Meanwhile, we propose a BEMCP model for the LRTC problem, which is optimally solved based on alternating direction multiplier (ADMM). Finally, the proposed method is applied to the data **restoration**s of multispectral image (MSI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and color video (CV) in real-world, and the experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-arts methods.

> ABSTRACT  :  Deep learning is a standard tool in the field of high-energy physics, facilitating considerable sensitivity **enhancement**s for numerous analysis strategies. In particular, in identification of physics objects, such as jet flavor tagging, complex neural network architectures play a major role. However, these methods are reliant on accurate simulations. Mismodeling can lead to non-negligible differences in performance in data that need to be measured and calibrated against. We investigate the classifier response to input data with injected mismodelings and probe the vulnerability of flavor tagging algorithms via application of adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we present an adversarial training strategy that mitigates the impact of such simulated attacks and improves the classifier robustness. We examine the relationship between performance and vulnerability and show that this method constitutes a promising approach to reduce the vulnerability to poor modeling.

> ABSTRACT  :  The brains of all **bilateral**ly symmetric animals on Earth are are divided into left and right hemispheres. The anatomy and functionality of the hemispheres have a large degree of overlap, but they specialize to possess different attributes. The left hemisphere is believed to specialize in specificity and routine, the right in generalities and novelty. In this study, we propose an artificial neural network that imitates that **bilateral** architecture using two convolutional neural networks with different training objectives and test it on an image classification task. The **bilateral** architecture outperforms architectures of similar representational capacity that don't exploit differential specialization. It demonstrates the efficacy of **bilateral**ism and constitutes a new principle that could be incorporated into other computational neuroscientific models and used as an inductive bias when designing new ML systems. An analysis of the model can help us to understand the human brain.

In this paper we (1) perform a systematic exploration of the hyperparameter space for self-attention based navigation of 3D environments and qualitatively appraise behaviour observed from different hyperparameter sets, including their ability to generalise; (2) present strategies to improve the agents' generalisation abilities and navigation behaviour; and (3) show how models trained in simulation are capable of processing real world images meaningfully in **real time**. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a self-attention based agent successfully trained in navigating a 3D action space, using less than 4000 parameters.  
### Self-Attentive Pooling for Efficient Deep Learning. (arXiv:2209.07659v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Efficient custom pooling techniques that can aggressively trim the dimensions of a feature map and thereby reduce inference compute and memory footprint for resource-constrained computer vision applications have recently gained significant traction. However, prior pooling works extract only the local context of the activation maps, limiting their effectiveness. In contrast, we propose a novel non-local self-attentive pooling method that can be used as a drop-in replacement to the standard pooling layers, such as max/average pooling or strided convolution. The proposed self-attention module uses patch embedding, multi-head self-attention, and spatial-channel **restoration**, followed by sigmoid activation and exponential soft-max. This self-attention mechanism efficiently aggregates dependencies between non-local activation patches during down-sampling. Extensive experiments on standard object classification and detection tasks with various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures demonstrate the superiority of our proposed mechanism over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) pooling techniques. In particular, we surpass the test accuracy of existing pooling techniques on different variants of MobileNet-V2 on ImageNet by an average of 1.2%. With the aggressive down-sampling of the activation maps in the initial layers (providing up to 22x reduction in memory consumption), our approach achieves 1.43% higher test accuracy compared to SOTA techniques with iso-memory footprints. This enables the deployment of our models in memory-constrained devices, such as micro-controllers (without losing significant accuracy), because the initial activation maps consume a significant amount of on-chip memory for high-resolution images required for complex vision tasks. Our proposed pooling method also leverages the idea of channel pruning to further reduce memory footprints.

### ERNIE-mmLayout: Multi-grained MultiModal Transformer for Document Understanding. (arXiv:2209.08569v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Recent efforts of multimodal Transformers have improved Visually Rich Document Understanding (VrDU) tasks via incorporating visual and textual information. However, existing approaches mainly focus on fine-grained elements such as words and document image patches, making it hard for them to learn from coarse-grained elements, including natural lexical units like phrases and salient visual regions like prominent image regions. In this paper, we attach more importance to coarse-grained elements containing high-density information and consistent semantics, which are valuable for document understanding. At first, a document graph is proposed to model complex relationships among multi-grained multimodal elements, in which salient visual regions are detected by a cluster-based method. Then, a multi-grained multimodal Transformer called mmLayout is proposed to incorporate coarse-grained information into existing pre-trained fine-grained multimodal Transformers based on the graph. In mmLayout, coarse-grained information is aggregated from fine-grained, and then, after further processing, is fused back into fine-grained for final prediction. Furthermore, common sense **enhancement** is introduced to exploit the semantic information of natural lexical units. Experimental results on four tasks, including information extraction and document question answering, show that our method can improve the performance of multimodal Transformers based on fine-grained elements and achieve better performance with fewer parameters. Qualitative analyses show that our method can capture consistent semantics in coarse-grained elements.

> ABSTRACT  :  The 3rd Generation Partnership Project started the study of Release 18 in 2021. Artificial intelligence (AI)-native air interface is one of the key features of Release 18, where AI for channel state information (CSI) feedback **enhancement** is selected as the representative use case. This article provides an overview of AI for CSI feedback **enhancement** in 5G-Advanced. Several representative non-AI and AI-enabled CSI feedback frameworks are first introduced and compared. Then, the standardization of AI for CSI feedback **enhancement** in 5G-advanced is presented in detail. First, the scope of the AI for CSI feedback **enhancement** in 5G-Advanced is presented and discussed. Then, the main challenges and open problems in the standardization of AI for CSI feedback **enhancement**, especially focusing on performance evaluation and the design of new protocols for AI-enabled CSI feedback, are identified and discussed. This article provides a guideline for the standardization study of AI-based CSI feedback **enhancement**.  
### Deep learning in a **bilateral** brain with hemispheric specialization. (arXiv:2209.06862v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  The brains of all **bilateral**ly symmetric animals on Earth are are divided into left and right hemispheres. The anatomy and functionality of the hemispheres have a large degree of overlap, but they specialize to possess different attributes. The left hemisphere is believed to specialize in specificity and routine, the right in generalities and novelty. In this study, we propose an artificial neural network that imitates that **bilateral** architecture using two convolutional neural networks with different training objectives and test it on an image classification task. The **bilateral** architecture outperforms architectures of similar representational capacity that don't exploit differential specialization. It demonstrates the efficacy of **bilateral**ism and constitutes a new principle that could be incorporated into other computational neuroscientific models and used as an inductive bias when designing new ML systems. An analysis of the model can help us to understand the human brain.
