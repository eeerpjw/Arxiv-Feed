### g**Swin**: Gated MLP Vision Model with Hierarchical Structure of Shifted Window. (arXiv:2208.11718v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Following the success in language domain, the self-attention mechanism (transformer) is adopted in the vision domain and achieving great success recently. Additionally, as another stream, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is also explored in the vision domain. These architectures, other than traditional CNNs, have been attracting attention recently, and many methods have been proposed. As one that combines parameter efficiency and performance with locality and hierarchy in image recognition, we propose g**Swin**, which merges the two streams; **Swin** Transformer and (multi-head) gMLP. We showed that our g**Swin** can achieve better accuracy on three vision tasks, image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, than **Swin** Transformer, with smaller model size.

> ABSTRACT  :  Cloth-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID), which aims to match person identities under clothing changes, is a new rising research topic in recent years. However, typical biometrics-based CC-ReID methods often require cumbersome pose or body part estimators to learn cloth-irrelevant features from human biometric traits, which comes with high computational costs. Besides, the performance is significantly limited due to the resolution degradation of surveillance images. To address the above limitations, we propose an effective Identity-Sensitive Knowledge Propagation framework (DeSKPro) for CC-ReID. Specifically, a Cloth-irrelevant Spatial Attention module is introduced to eliminate the distraction of clothing appearance by acquiring knowledge from the human parsing module. To mitigate the resolution degradation issue and mine identity-sensitive cues from human faces, we propose to restore the missing facial details using prior facial knowledge, which is then propagated to a smaller network. After training, the extra computations for human parsing or face **restoration** are no longer required. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/KimbingNg/DeskPro.

> ABSTRACT  :  Transformers have recently gained significant attention in the computer vision community. However, the lack of scalability of self-attention mechanisms with respect to image size has limited their wide adoption in state-of-the-art vision backbones. In this paper we introduce an efficient and scalable attention model we call multi-axis attention, which consists of two aspects: blocked local and dilated global attention. These design choices allow global-local spatial interactions on arbitrary input resolutions with only linear complexity. We also present a new architectural element by effectively blending our proposed attention model with convolutions, and accordingly propose a simple hierarchical vision backbone, dubbed MaxViT, by simply repeating the basic building block over multiple stages. Notably, MaxViT is able to ''see'' globally throughout the entire network, even in earlier, high-resolution stages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a broad spectrum of vision tasks. On image classification, MaxViT achieves state-of-the-art performance under various settings: without extra data, MaxViT attains 86.5% ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy; with ImageNet-21K pre-training, our model achieves 88.7% top-1 accuracy. For downstream tasks, MaxViT as a backbone delivers favorable performance on object detection as well as visual aesthetic assessment. We also show that our proposed model expresses strong generative modeling capability on ImageNet, demonstrating the superior potential of MaxViT blocks as a universal vision module. The source code and trained models will be available at https://github.com/google-research/maxvit.

### Empirical study of Machine Learning Classifier Evaluation Metrics behavior in Massively Imbalanced and Noisy data. (arXiv:2208.11904v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  With growing credit card transaction volumes, the fraud percentages are also rising, including overhead costs for institutions to combat and compensate victims. The use of machine learning into the financial sector permits more effective protection against fraud and other economic crime. Suitably trained machine learning classifiers help proactive fraud detection, improving stakeholder trust and robustness against illicit transactions. However, the design of machine learning based fraud detection algorithms has been challenging and slow due the massively unbalanced nature of fraud data and the challenges of identifying the frauds accurately and completely to create a gold standard ground truth. Furthermore, there are no benchmarks or standard classifier evaluation metrics to measure and identify better performing classifiers, thus keeping researchers in the **dark**.    In this work, we develop a theoretical foundation to model human annotation errors and extreme imbalance typical in real world fraud detection data sets. By conducting empirical experiments on a hypothetical classifier, with a synthetic data distribution approximated to a popular real world credit card fraud data set, we simulate human annotation errors and extreme imbalance to observe the behavior of popular machine learning classifier evaluation matrices. We demonstrate that a combined F1 score and g-mean, in that specific order, is the best evaluation metric for typical imbalanced fraud detection model classification.

### Mind the Gap! A Study on the Transferability of Virtual vs Physical-world Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems. (arXiv:2112.11255v2 [cs.SE] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Safe deployment of self-driving cars (SDC) necessitates thorough simulated and in-field testing. Most testing techniques consider virtualized SDCs within a simulation environment, whereas less effort has been directed towards assessing whether such techniques transfer to and are effective with a physical real-world vehicle. In this paper, we shed light on the problem of generalizing testing results obtained in a driving simulator to a physical platform and provide a characterization and quantification of the sim2real gap affecting SDC testing. In our empirical study, we compare SDC testing when deployed on a physical small-scale vehicle vs its digital twin. Due to the unavailability of driving quality indicators from the physical platform, we use neural rendering to estimate them through visual odometry, hence allowing full comparability with the digital twin. Then, we investigate the transferability of behavior and failure **exposure** between virtual and real-world environments, targeting both unintended abnormal test data and intended adversarial examples. Our study shows that, despite the usage of a faithful digital twin, there are still critical shortcomings that contribute to the reality gap between the virtual and physical world, threatening existing testing solutions that only consider virtual SDCs. On the positive side, our results present the test configurations for which physical testing can be avoided, either because their outcome does transfer between virtual and physical environments, or because the uncertainty profiles in the simulator can help predict their outcome in the real world.
