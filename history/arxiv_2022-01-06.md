> ABSTRACT  :  It is challenging to restore low-resolution (LR) images to super-resolution (SR) images with correct and clear details. Existing deep learning works almost neglect the inherent structural information of images, which acts as an important role for visual perception of SR results. In this paper, we design a hierarchical feature exploitation network to probe and preserve structural information in a multi-scale feature fusion manner. First, we propose a cross convolution upon traditional edge detectors to localize and represent edge features. Then, cross convolution blocks (CCBs) are designed with feature normalization and channel attention to consider the inherent correlations of features. Finally, we leverage multi-scale feature fusion group (MFFG) to embed the cross convolution blocks and develop the relations of structural features in different scales hierarchically, invoking a lightweight structure-preserving network named as Cross-SRN. Experimental results demonstrate the Cross-SRN achieves competitive or superior **restoration** performances against the state-of-the-art methods with accurate and clear structural details. Moreover, we set a criterion to select images with rich structural textures. The proposed Cross-SRN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the selected benchmark, which demonstrates that our network has a significant advantage in preserving edges.

> ABSTRACT  :  Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a part of everyday conversation and our lives. It is considered as the new electricity that is revolutionizing the world. AI is heavily invested in both industry and academy. However, there is also a lot of hype in the current AI debate. AI based on so-called deep learning has achieved impressive results in many problems, but its limits are already visible. AI has been under research since the 1940s, and the industry has seen many ups and downs due to over-expectations and related disappointments that have followed.    The purpose of this book is to give a realistic picture of AI, its history, its potential and limitations. We believe that AI is a helper, not a ruler of humans. We begin by describing what AI is and how it has evolved over the decades. After fundamentals, we explain the importance of massive data for the current mainstream of artificial intelligence. The most common representations for AI, methods, and machine learning are covered. In addition, the main application areas are introduced. Computer vision has been central to the development of AI. The book provides a general introduction to computer vision, and includes an **exposure** to the results and applications of our own research. Emotions are central to human intelligence, but little use has been made in AI. We present the basics of emotional intelligence and our own research on the topic. We discuss super-intelligence that transcends human understanding, explaining why such achievement seems impossible on the basis of present knowledge,and how AI could be improved. Finally, a summary is made of the current state of AI and what to do in the future. In the appendix, we look at the development of AI education, especially from the perspective of contents at our own university.  
### Improved **Real-Time** Monocular SLAM Using Semantic Segmentation on Selective Frames. (arXiv:2105.00114v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is emerging in advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving, because a single camera is cheap and easy to install. Conventional monocular SLAM has two major challenges leading inaccurate localization and mapping. First, it is challenging to estimate scales in localization and mapping. Second, conventional monocular SLAM uses inappropriate mapping factors such as dynamic objects and low-parallax areas in mapping. This paper proposes an improved real-time monocular SLAM that resolves the aforementioned challenges by efficiently using deep learning-based semantic segmentation. To achieve the real-time execution of the proposed method, we apply semantic segmentation only to downsampled keyframes in parallel with mapping processes. In addition, the proposed method corrects scales of camera poses and three-dimensional (3D) points, using estimated ground plane from road-labeled 3D points and the real camera height. The proposed method also removes inappropriate corner features labeled as moving objects and low parallax areas. Experiments with eight video sequences demonstrate that the proposed monocular SLAM system achieves significantly improved and comparable trajectory tracking accuracy, compared to existing state-of-the-art monocular and stereo SLAM systems, respectively. The proposed system can achieve real-time tracking on a standard CPU potentially with a standard GPU support, whereas existing segmentation-aided monocular SLAM does not.  
### Complementary Feature Enhanced Network with Vision Transformer for Image Dehazing. (arXiv:2109.07100v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Conventional CNNs-based dehazing models suffer from two essential issues: the dehazing framework (limited in interpretability) and the convolution layers (content-independent and ineffective to learn long-range dependency information). In this paper, firstly, we propose a new complementary feature enhanced framework, in which the complementary features are learned by several complementary subtasks and then together serve to boost the performance of the primary task. One of the prominent advantages of the new framework is that the purposively chosen complementary tasks can focus on learning weakly dependent complementary features, avoiding repetitive and ineffective learning of the networks. We design a new dehazing network based on such a framework. Specifically, we select the intrinsic image decomposition as the complementary tasks, where the reflectance and shading prediction subtasks are used to extract the color-wise and texture-wise complementary features. To effectively aggregate these complementary features, we propose a complementary features selection module (CFSM) to select the more useful features for image dehazing. Furthermore, we introduce a new version of vision transformer block, named Hybrid Local-Global Vision Transformer (HyLoG-ViT), and incorporate it within our dehazing networks. The HyLoG-ViT block consists of the local and the global vision transformer paths used to capture local and global dependencies. As a result, the HyLoG-ViT introduces locality in the networks and captures the global and long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on homogeneous, non-homogeneous, and **night**time dehazing tasks reveal that the proposed dehazing network can achieve comparable or even better performance than CNNs-based dehazing models.  
### MoCoPnet: Exploring Local Motion and Contrast Priors for Infrared Small Target Super-Resolution. (arXiv:2201.01014v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Infrared small target super-resolution (SR) aims to recover reliable and detailed high-resolution image with highcontrast targets from its low-resolution counterparts. Since the infrared small target lacks color and fine structure information, it is significant to exploit the supplementary information among sequence images to enhance the target. In this paper, we propose the first infrared small target SR method named local motion and contrast prior driven deep network (MoCoPnet) to integrate the domain knowledge of infrared small target into deep network, which can mitigate the intrinsic feature scarcity of infrared small targets. Specifically, motivated by the local motion prior in the spatio-temporal dimension, we propose a local spatiotemporal attention module to perform implicit frame alignment and incorporate the local spatio-temporal information to enhance the local features (especially for small targets). Motivated by the local contrast prior in the spatial dimension, we propose a central difference residual group to incorporate the central difference convolution into the feature extraction backbone, which can achieve center-oriented gradient-aware feature extraction to further improve the target contrast. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method can recover accurate spatial dependency and improve the target contrast. Comparative results show that MoCoPnet can outperform the state-of-the-art video SR and single image SR methods in terms of both SR performance and target **enhancement**. Based on the SR results, we further investigate the influence of SR on infrared small target detection and the experimental results demonstrate that MoCoPnet promotes the detection performance.

### Using Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection on a System-on-Chip under Gamma Radiation. (arXiv:2201.01588v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  The emergence of new nanoscale technologies has imposed significant challenges to designing reliable electronic systems in radiation environments. A few types of radiation like Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects often cause permanent damages on such nanoscale electronic devices, and current state-of-the-art technologies to tackle TID make use of expensive radiation-hardened devices. This paper focuses on a novel and different approach: using machine learning algorithms on consumer electronic level Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to tackle TID effects and monitor them to replace before they stop working. This condition has a research challenge to anticipate when the board results in a total failure due to TID effects. We observed internal measurements of the FPGA boards under gamma radiation and used three different anomaly detection machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect anomalies in the sensor measurements in a gamma-radiated environment. The statistical results show a highly significant relationship between the gamma radiation **exposure** levels and the board measurements. Moreover, our anomaly detection results have shown that a One-Class Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function Kernel has an average Recall score of 0.95. Also, all anomalies can be detected before the boards stop working.  
### ROOM: Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks Under **Real-Time** Constraints. (arXiv:2201.01621v1 [cs.CR])

> ABSTRACT  :  Advances in deep learning have enabled a wide range of promising applications. However, these systems are vulnerable to Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) attacks; adversarially crafted perturbations to their inputs could cause them to misclassify. Several state-of-the-art adversarial attacks have demonstrated that they can reliably fool classifiers making these attacks a significant threat. Adversarial attack generation algorithms focus primarily on creating successful examples while controlling the noise magnitude and distribution to make detection more difficult. The underlying assumption of these attacks is that the adversarial noise is generated offline, making their execution time a secondary consideration. However, recently, just-in-time adversarial attacks where an attacker opportunistically generates adversarial examples on the fly have been shown to be possible. This paper introduces a new problem: how do we generate adversarial noise under real-time constraints to support such real-time adversarial attacks? Understanding this problem improves our understanding of the threat these attacks pose to real-time systems and provides security evaluation benchmarks for future defenses. Therefore, we first conduct a run-time analysis of adversarial generation algorithms. Universal attacks produce a general attack offline, with no online overhead, and can be applied to any input; however, their success rate is limited because of their generality. In contrast, online algorithms, which work on a specific input, are computationally expensive, making them inappropriate for operation under time constraints. Thus, we propose ROOM, a novel Real-time Online-Offline attack construction Model where an offline component serves to warm up the online algorithm, making it possible to generate highly successful attacks under time constraints.
