> ABSTRACT  :  Upscaled video detection is a helpful tool in multimedia forensics, but it is a challenging task that involves various upscaling and compression algorithms. There are many resolution-**enhancement** methods, including interpolation and deep-learning-based super-resolution, and they leave unique traces. In this work, we propose a new upscaled-resolution-detection method based on learning of visual representations using contrastive and cross-entropy losses. To explain how the method detects videos, we systematically review the major components of our framework - in particular, we show that most data-augmentation approaches hinder the learning of the method. Through extensive experiments on various datasets, we demonstrate that our method effectively detects upscaling even in compressed videos and outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/msu-video-group/SRDM

> ABSTRACT  :  Image inpainting has achieved great advances by simultaneously leveraging image structure and texture features. However, due to lack of effective multi-feature fusion techniques, existing image inpainting methods still show limited improvement. In this paper, we design a deep multi-feature co-learning network for image inpainting, which includes Soft-gating Dual Feature Fusion (SDFF) and **Bilateral** Propagation Feature Aggregation (BPFA) modules. To be specific, we first use two branches to learn structure features and texture features separately. Then the proposed SDFF module integrates structure features into texture features, and meanwhile uses texture features as an auxiliary in generating structure features. Such a co-learning strategy makes the structure and texture features more consistent. Next, the proposed BPFA module enhances the connection from local feature to overall consistency by co-learning contextual attention, channel-wise information and feature space, which can further refine the generated structures and textures. Finally, extensive experiments are performed on benchmark datasets, including CelebA, Places2, and Paris StreetView. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art. The source codes are available at https://github.com/GZHU-DVL/MFCL-Inpainting.  
### Vision Transformers in 2022: An Update on Tiny ImageNet. (arXiv:2205.10660v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  The recent advances in image transformers have shown impressive results and have largely closed the gap between traditional CNN architectures. The standard procedure is to train on large datasets like ImageNet-21k and then finetune on ImageNet-1k. After finetuning, researches will often consider the transfer learning performance on smaller datasets such as CIFAR-10/100 but have left out Tiny ImageNet. This paper offers an update on vision transformers' performance on Tiny ImageNet. I include Vision Transformer (ViT) , Data Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), Class Attention in Image Transformer (CaiT), and **Swin** Transformers. In addition, **Swin** Transformers beats the current state-of-the-art result with a validation accuracy of 91.35%. Code is available here: https://github.com/ehuynh1106/TinyImageNet-Transformers  
### Road surface 3d reconstruction based on dense subpixel disparity map estimation. (arXiv:1807.01874v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Various 3D reconstruction methods have enabled civil engineers to detect damage on a road surface. To achieve the millimetre accuracy required for road condition assessment, a disparity map with subpixel resolution needs to be used. However, none of the existing stereo matching algorithms are specially suitable for the reconstruction of the road surface. Hence in this paper, we propose a novel dense subpixel disparity estimation algorithm with high computational efficiency and robustness. This is achieved by first transforming the perspective view of the target frame into the reference view, which not only increases the accuracy of the block matching for the road surface but also improves the processing speed. The disparities are then estimated iteratively using our previously published algorithm where the search range is propagated from three estimated neighbouring disparities. Since the search range is obtained from the previous iteration, errors may occur when the propagated search range is not sufficient. Therefore, a correlation maxima verification is performed to rectify this issue, and the subpixel resolution is achieved by conducting a parabola interpolation **enhancement**. Furthermore, a novel disparity global refinement approach developed from the Markov Random Fields and Fast **Bilateral** Stereo is introduced to further improve the accuracy of the estimated disparity map, where disparities are updated iteratively by minimising the energy function that is related to their interpolated correlation polynomials. The algorithm is implemented in C language with a near real-time performance. The experimental results illustrate that the absolute error of the reconstruction varies from 0.1 mm to 3 mm.

> ABSTRACT  :  Salient object detection in complex scenes and environments is a challenging research topic. Most works focus on RGB-based salient object detection, which limits its performance of real-life applications when confronted with adverse conditions such as **dark** environments and complex backgrounds. Taking advantage of RGB and thermal infrared images becomes a new research direction for detecting salient object in complex scenes recently, as thermal infrared spectrum imaging provides the complementary information and has been applied to many computer vision tasks. However, current research for RGBT salient object detection is limited by the lack of a large-scale dataset and comprehensive benchmark. This work contributes such a RGBT image dataset named VT5000, including 5000 spatially aligned RGBT image pairs with ground truth annotations. VT5000 has 11 challenges collected in different scenes and environments for exploring the robustness of algorithms. With this dataset, we propose a powerful baseline approach, which extracts multi-level features within each modality and aggregates these features of all modalities with the attention mechanism, for accurate RGBT salient object detection. Extensive experiments show that the proposed baseline approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on VT5000 dataset and other two public datasets. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive analysis of different algorithms of RGBT salient object detection on VT5000 dataset, and then make several valuable conclusions and provide some potential research directions for RGBT salient object detection.  
### CERL: A Unified Optimization Framework for Light **Enhancement** with Realistic Noise. (arXiv:2108.00478v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Zeyuan Chen, Yifan Jiang, Dong Liu, Zhangyang Wang

> ABSTRACT  :  **Low-light** images captured in the real world are inevitably corrupted by sensor noise. Such noise is spatially variant and highly dependent on the underlying pixel intensity, deviating from the oversimplified assumptions in conventional denoising. Existing light **enhancement** methods either overlook the important impact of real-world noise during **enhancement**, or treat noise removal as a separate pre- or post-processing step. We present \underline{C}oordinated \underline{E}nhancement for \underline{R}eal-world \underline{L}ow-light Noisy Images (CERL), that seamlessly integrates light **enhancement** and noise suppression parts into a unified and physics-grounded optimization framework. For the real **low-light** noise removal part, we customize a self-supervised denoising model that can easily be adapted without referring to clean ground-truth images. For the light **enhancement** part, we also improve the design of a state-of-the-art backbone. The two parts are then joint formulated into one principled plug-and-play optimization. Our approach is compared against state-of-the-art **low-light** **enhancement** methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Besides standard benchmarks, we further collect and test on a new realistic **low-light** mobile photography dataset (RLMP), whose mobile-captured photos display heavier realistic noise than those taken by high-quality cameras. CERL consistently produces the most visually pleasing and artifact-free results across all experiments. Our RLMP dataset and codes are available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/CERL.  
### PhysFormer: Facial Video-based Physiological Measurement with Temporal Difference Transformer. (arXiv:2111.12082v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), which aims at measuring heart activities and physiological signals from facial video without any contact, has great potential in many applications (e.g., remote healthcare and affective computing). Recent deep learning approaches focus on mining subtle rPPG clues using convolutional neural networks with limited spatio-temporal receptive fields, which neglect the long-range spatio-temporal perception and interaction for rPPG modeling. In this paper, we propose the PhysFormer, an end-to-end video transformer based architecture, to adaptively aggregate both local and global spatio-temporal features for rPPG representation **enhancement**. As key modules in PhysFormer, the temporal difference transformers first enhance the quasi-periodic rPPG features with temporal difference guided global attention, and then refine the local spatio-temporal representation against interference. Furthermore, we also propose the label distribution learning and a curriculum learning inspired dynamic constraint in frequency domain, which provide elaborate supervisions for PhysFormer and alleviate overfitting. Comprehensive experiments are performed on four benchmark datasets to show our superior performance on both intra- and cross-dataset testings. One highlight is that, unlike most transformer networks needed pretraining from large-scale datasets, the proposed PhysFormer can be easily trained from scratch on rPPG datasets, which makes it promising as a novel transformer baseline for the rPPG community. The codes will be released at https://github.com/ZitongYu/PhysFormer.  
### RestoreFormer: High-Quality Blind Face **Restoration** from Undegraded Key-Value Pairs. (arXiv:2201.06374v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Blind face **restoration** is to recover a high-quality face image from unknown degradations. As face image contains abundant contextual information, we propose a method, RestoreFormer, which explores fully-spatial attentions to model contextual information and surpasses existing works that use local operators. RestoreFormer has several benefits compared to prior arts. First, unlike the conventional multi-head self-attention in previous Vision Transformers (ViTs), RestoreFormer incorporates a multi-head cross-attention layer to learn fully-spatial interactions between corrupted queries and high-quality key-value pairs. Second, the key-value pairs in ResotreFormer are sampled from a reconstruction-oriented high-quality dictionary, whose elements are rich in high-quality facial features specifically aimed for face reconstruction, leading to superior **restoration** results. Third, RestoreFormer outperforms advanced state-of-the-art methods on one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets, as well as produces images with better visual quality.  
### MSTRIQ: No Reference Image Quality Assessment Based on **Swin** Transformer with Multi-Stage Fusion. (arXiv:2205.10101v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Measuring the perceptual quality of images automatically is an essential task in the area of computer vision, as degradations on image quality can exist in many processes from image acquisition, transmission to enhancing. Many Image Quality Assessment(IQA) algorithms have been designed to tackle this problem. However, it still remains un settled due to the various types of image distortions and the lack of large-scale human-rated datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on the **Swin** Transformer [31] with fused features from multiple stages, which aggregates information from both local and global features to better predict the quality. To address the issues of small-scale datasets, relative rankings of images have been taken into account together with regression loss to simultaneously optimize the model. Furthermore, effective data augmentation strategies are also used to improve the performance. In comparisons with previous works, experiments are carried out on two standard IQA datasets and a challenge dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our work. The proposed method outperforms other methods on standard datasets and ranks 2nd in the no-reference track of NTIRE 2022 Perceptual Image Quality Assessment Challenge [53]. It verifies that our method is promising in solving diverse IQA problems and thus can be used to real-word applications.

### Multi-layer Feature Fusion Convolution Network for Audio-visual Speech **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2101.05975v3 [eess.AS] UPDATED)
- Authors : Xinmeng Xu, Jianjun Hao
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05975](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05975)
> ABSTRACT  :  Speech **enhancement** can potentially benefit from the visual information from the target speaker, such as lip movement and facial expressions, because the visual aspect of speech is essentially unaffected by acoustic environment. In this paper, we address the problem of enhancing corrupted speech signal from videos by using audio-visual (AV) neural processing. Most of recent AV speech **enhancement** approaches separately process the acoustic and visual features and fuse them via a simple concatenation operation. Although this strategy is convenient and easy to implement, it comes with two major drawbacks: 1) evidence in speech perception suggests that in humans the AV integration occurs at a very early stage, in contrast to previous models that process the two modalities separately at early stage and combine them only at a later stage, thus making the system less robust, and 2) a simple concatenation does not allow to control how the information from the acoustic and the visual modalities is treated. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a multi-layer feature fusion convolution network (MFFCN), which separately process acoustic and visual modalities for preserving each modality features while fusing both modalities' features layer by layer in encoding phase for enjoying the human AV speech perception. In addition, considering the balance between the two modalities, we design channel and spectral attention mechanisms to provide additional flexibility in dealing with different types of information expanding the representational ability of the convolution neural network. Experimental results show that the proposed MFFCN demonstrates the performance of the network superior to the state-of-the-art models.

### Prototyping three key properties of specific curiosity in computational reinforcement learning. (arXiv:2205.10407v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Roshan Shariff, University of, Alberta Department, of Computing, Science and, Alberta Machine, Intelligence Institute
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10407](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10407)
> ABSTRACT  :  Curiosity for machine agents has been a focus of intense research. The study of human and animal curiosity, particularly specific curiosity, has unearthed several properties that would offer important benefits for machine learners, but that have not yet been well-explored in machine intelligence. In this work, we introduce three of the most immediate of these properties -- directedness, cessation when satisfied, and voluntary **exposure** -- and show how they may be implemented together in a proof-of-concept reinforcement learning agent; further, we demonstrate how the properties manifest in the behaviour of this agent in a simple non-episodic grid-world environment that includes curiosity-inducing locations and induced targets of curiosity. As we would hope, the agent exhibits short-term directed behaviour while updating long-term preferences to adaptively seek out curiosity-inducing situations. This work therefore presents a novel view into how specific curiosity operates and in the future might be integrated into the behaviour of goal-seeking, decision-making agents in complex environments.

### Scenario-based Multi-product Advertising Copywriting Generation for E-Commerce. (arXiv:2205.10530v1 [cs.AI])
- Authors : Xueying Zhang, Kai Shen, Chi Zhang, Xiaochuan Fan, Yun Xiao, Zhen He, Bo Long, Lingfei Wu
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10530](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10530)
> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we proposed an automatic Scenario-based Multi-product Advertising Copywriting Generation system (SMPACG) for E-Commerce, which has been deployed on a leading Chinese e-commerce platform. The proposed SMPACG consists of two main components: 1) an automatic multi-product combination selection module, which itself is consisted of a topic prediction model, a pattern and attribute-based selection model and an arbitrator model; and 2) an automatic multi-product advertising copywriting generation module, which combines our proposed domain-specific pretrained language model and knowledge-based data **enhancement** model. The SMPACG is the first system that realizes automatic scenario-based multi-product advertising contents generation, which achieves significant improvements over other state-of-the-art methods. The SMPACG has been not only developed for directly serving for our e-commerce recommendation system, but also used as a real-time writing assistant tool for merchants.  
### Multi-Agent Feedback Enabled Neural Networks for Intelligent Communications. (arXiv:2205.10750v1 [cs.AI])

> ABSTRACT  :  In the intelligent communication field, deep learning (DL) has attracted much attention due to its strong fitting ability and data-driven learning capability. Compared with the typical DL feedforward network structures, an **enhancement** structure with direct data feedback have been studied and proved to have better performance than the feedfoward networks. However, due to the above simple feedback methods lack sufficient analysis and learning ability on the feedback data, it is inadequate to deal with more complicated nonlinear systems and therefore the performance is limited for further improvement. In this paper, a novel multi-agent feedback enabled neural network (MAFENN) framework is proposed, which make the framework have stronger feedback learning capabilities and more intelligence on feature abstraction, denoising or generation, etc. Furthermore, the MAFENN framework is theoretically formulated into a three-player Feedback Stackelberg game, and the game is proved to converge to the Feedback Stackelberg equilibrium. The design of MAFENN framework and algorithm are dedicated to enhance the learning capability of the feedfoward DL networks or their variations with the simple data feedback. To verify the MAFENN framework's feasibility in wireless communications, a multi-agent MAFENN based equalizer (MAFENN-E) is developed for wireless fading channels with inter-symbol interference (ISI). Experimental results show that when the quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation scheme is adopted, the SER performance of our proposed method outperforms that of the traditional equalizers by about 2 dB in linear channels. When in nonlinear channels, the SER performance of our proposed method outperforms that of either traditional or DL based equalizers more significantly, which shows the effectiveness and robustness of our proposal in the complex channel environment.
