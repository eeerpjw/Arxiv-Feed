> ABSTRACT  :  We introduce a new class of iterative image reconstruction algorithms for radio interferometry, at the interface of convex optimization and deep learning, inspired by plug-and-play methods. The approach consists in learning a prior image model by training a deep neural network (DNN) as a denoiser, and substituting it for the handcrafted proximal regularization operator of an optimization algorithm. The proposed AIRI ("AI for Regularization in Radio-Interferometric Imaging") framework, for imaging complex intensity structure with diffuse and faint emission, inherits the robustness and interpretability of optimization, and the learning power and speed of networks. Our approach relies on three steps. Firstly, we design a low dynamic range database for supervised training from optical intensity images. Secondly, we train a DNN denoiser with basic architecture ensuring positivity of the output image, at a noise level inferred from the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. We use either $\ell_2$ or $\ell_1$ training losses, enhanced with a nonexpansiveness term ensuring algorithm convergence, and including on-the-fly database dynamic range **enhancement** via exponentiation. Thirdly, we plug the learned denoiser into the forward-backward optimization algorithm, resulting in a simple iterative structure alternating a denoising step with a gradient-descent data-fidelity step. The resulting AIRI-$\ell_2$ and AIRI-$\ell_1$ were validated against CLEAN and optimization algorithms of the SARA family, propelled by the "average sparsity" proximal regularization operator. Simulation results show that these first AIRI incarnations are competitive in imaging quality with SARA and its unconstrained forward-backward-based version uSARA, while providing significant acceleration. CLEAN remains faster but offers lower reconstruction quality.

> ABSTRACT  :  Lane detection is an integral part of control systems in autonomous vehicles and lane departure warning systems as lanes are a key component of the operating environment for road vehicles. In a previous paper, a robust neural network output **enhancement** for active lane detection (RONELD) method augmenting deep learning lane detection models to improve active, or ego, lane accuracy performance was presented. This paper extends the work by further investigating the lane tracking methods used to increase robustness of the method to lane changes and different lane dimensions (e.g. lane marking thickness) and proposes an improved, lighter weight lane detection method, RONELDv2. It improves on the previous RONELD method by detecting the lane point variance, merging lanes to find a more accurate set of lane parameters, and using an exponential moving average method to calculate more robust lane weights. Experiments using the proposed improvements show a consistent increase in lane detection accuracy results across different datasets and deep learning models, as well as a decrease in computational complexity observed via an up to two-fold decrease in runtime, which enhances its suitability for real-time use on autonomous vehicles and lane departure warning systems.  
### DGSS : Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation using Iterative Style Mining and Latent Representation Alignment. (arXiv:2202.13144v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Semantic segmentation algorithms require access to well-annotated datasets captured under diverse illumination conditions to ensure consistent performance. However, poor visibility conditions at varying illumination conditions result in laborious and error-prone labeling. Alternatively, using synthetic samples to train segmentation algorithms has gained interest with the drawback of domain gap that results in sub-optimal performance. While current state-of-the-art (SoTA) have proposed different mechanisms to bridge the domain gap, they still perform poorly in low illumination conditions with an average performance drop of - 10.7 mIOU. In this paper, we focus upon single source domain generalization to overcome the domain gap and propose a two-step framework wherein we first identify an adversarial style that maximizes the domain gap between stylized and source images. Subsequently, these stylized images are used to categorically align features such that features belonging to the same class are clustered together in latent space, irrespective of domain gap. Furthermore, to increase intra-class variance while training, we propose a style mixing mechanism wherein the same objects from different styles are mixed to construct a new training image. This framework allows us to achieve a domain generalized semantic segmentation algorithm with consistent performance without prior information of the target domain while relying on a single source. Based on extensive experiments, we match SoTA performance on SYNTHIA $\to$ Cityscapes, GTAV $\to$ Cityscapes while setting new SoTA on GTAV $\to$ **Dark** Zurich and GTAV $\to$ **Night** Driving benchmarks without retraining.

> ABSTRACT  :  For scene understanding in robotics and automated driving, there is a growing interest in solving semantic segmentation tasks with transformer-based methods. However, effective transformers are always too cumbersome and computationally expensive to solve semantic segmentation in **real time**, which is desired for robotic systems. Moreover, due to the lack of inductive biases compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), pre-training on a large dataset is essential but it takes a long time. Knowledge Distillation (KD) speeds up inference and maintains accuracy while transferring knowledge from a pre-trained cumbersome teacher model to a compact student model. Most traditional KD methods for CNNs focus on response-based knowledge and feature-based knowledge. In contrast, we present a novel KD framework according to the nature of transformers, i.e., training compact transformers by transferring the knowledge from feature maps and patch embeddings of large transformers. To this purpose, two modules are proposed: (1) the Selective Kernel Fusion (SKF) module, which helps to construct an efficient relation-based KD framework, Selective Kernel Review (SKR); (2) the Patch Embedding Alignment (PEA) module, which performs the dimensional transformation of patch embeddings. The combined KD framework is called SKR+PEA. Through comprehensive experiments on Cityscapes and ACDC datasets, it indicates that our proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art KD frameworks and rivals the time-consuming pre-training method. Code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/RuipingL/SKR_PEA.git

> ABSTRACT  :  Enabling Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) requires high-fidelity and real-time perception information, which is available from onboard sensors or vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. Nevertheless, the accessibility of this information may suffer from the range and occlusion of perception or limited penetration rates in connectivity. In this paper, we introduce the prototype of Cyber Mobility Mirror (CMM), a next-generation real-time traffic surveillance system for 3D object detection, classification, tracking, and reconstruction, to provide CAVs with wide-range high-fidelity perception information in a mixed traffic environment. The CMM system consists of six main components: 1) the data pre-processor to retrieve and pre-process raw data from the roadside LiDAR; 2) the 3D object detector to generate 3D bounding boxes based on point cloud data; 3) the multi-objects tracker to endow unique IDs to detected objects and estimate their dynamic states; 4) the global locator to map positioning information from the LiDAR coordinate to geographic coordinate using coordinate transformation; 5) the cloud-based communicator to transmit perception information from roadside sensors to equipped vehicles; and 6) the onboard advisor to reconstruct and display the real-time traffic conditions via Graphical User Interface (GUI). In this study, a field-operational prototype system is deployed at a real-world intersection, University Avenue and Iowa Avenue in Riverside, California to assess the feasibility and performance of our CMM system. Results from field tests demonstrate that our CMM prototype system can provide satisfactory perception performance with 96.99% precision and 83.62% recall. High-fidelity real-time traffic conditions (at the object level) can be displayed on the GUI of the equipped vehicle with a frequency of 3-4 Hz.

> ABSTRACT  :  Guided filter is a fundamental tool in computer vision and computer graphics which aims to transfer structure information from guidance image to target image. Most existing methods construct filter kernels from the guidance itself without considering the mutual dependency between the guidance and the target. However, since there typically exist significantly different edges in the two images, simply transferring all structural information of the guidance to the target would result in various artifacts. To cope with this problem, we propose an effective framework named deep attentional guided image filtering, the filtering process of which can fully integrate the complementary information contained in both images. Specifically, we propose an attentional kernel learning module to generate dual sets of filter kernels from the guidance and the target, respectively, and then adaptively combine them by modeling the pixel-wise dependency between the two images. Meanwhile, we propose a multi-scale guided image filtering module to progressively generate the filtering result with the constructed kernels in a coarse-to-fine manner. Correspondingly, a multi-scale fusion strategy is introduced to reuse the intermediate results in the coarse-to-fine process. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework compares favorably with the state-of-the-art methods in a wide range of guided image filtering applications, such as guided super-resolution, cross-modality **restoration**, texture removal, and semantic segmentation.

> ABSTRACT  :  While action recognition (AR) has gained large improvements with the introduction of large-scale video datasets and the development of deep neural networks, AR models robust to challenging environments in real-world scenarios are still under-explored. We focus on the task of action recognition in **dark** environments, which can be applied to fields such as surveillance and autonomous driving at **night**. Intuitively, current deep networks along with visual **enhancement** techniques should be able to handle AR in **dark** environments, however, it is observed that this is not always the case in practice. To dive deeper into exploring solutions for AR in **dark** environments, we launched the UG2+ Challenge Track 2 (UG2-2) in IEEE CVPR 2021, with a goal of evaluating and advancing the robustness of AR models in **dark** environments. The challenge builds and expands on top of a novel ARID dataset, the first dataset for the task of **dark** video AR, and guides models to tackle such a task in both fully and semi-supervised manners. Baseline results utilizing current AR models and **enhancement** methods are reported, justifying the challenging nature of this task with substantial room for improvements. Thanks to the active participation from the research community, notable advances have been made in participants' solutions, while analysis of these solutions helped better identify possible directions to tackle the challenge of AR in **dark** environments.

> ABSTRACT  :  Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, so early pathological examination is very important. However, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to identify the number and type of cells on H&amp;E images in clinical. Therefore, automatic segmentation and classification task and counting the cellular composition of H&amp;E images from pathological sections is proposed by CoNIC Challenge 2022. We proposed a multi-scale **Swin** transformer with HTC for this challenge, and also applied the known normalization methods to generate more augmentation data. Finally, our strategy showed that the multi-scale played a crucial role to identify different scale features and the augmentation arose the recognition of model.

> ABSTRACT  :  Image **restoration** is a challenging ill-posed problem which also has been a long-standing issue. In the past few years, the convolution neural networks (CNNs) almost dominated the computer vision and had achieved considerable success in different levels of vision tasks including image **restoration**. However, recently the **Swin** Transformer-based model also shows impressive performance, even surpasses the CNN-based methods to become the state-of-the-art on high-level vision tasks. In this paper, we proposed a **restoration** model called SUNet which uses the **Swin** Transformer layer as our basic block and then is applied to UNet architecture for image denoising. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/FanChiMao/SUNet.

### High Dimensional Statistical Estimation under One-bit Quantization. (arXiv:2202.13157v1 [stat.ML])
- Authors : Junren Chen, Long Wang, Di Wang
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13157](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13157)
> ABSTRACT  :  Compared with data with high precision, one-bit (binary) data are preferable in many applications because of the efficiency in signal storage, processing, transmission, and **enhancement** of privacy. In this paper, we study three fundamental statistical estimation problems, i.e., sparse covariance matrix estimation, sparse linear regression, and low-rank matrix completion via binary data arising from an easy-to-implement one-bit quantization process that contains truncation, dithering and quantization as typical steps. Under both sub-Gaussian and heavy-tailed regimes, new estimators that handle high-dimensional scaling are proposed. In sub-Gaussian case, we show that our estimators achieve minimax rates up to logarithmic factors, hence the quantization nearly costs nothing from the perspective of statistical learning rate. In heavy-tailed case, we truncate the data before dithering to achieve a bias-variance trade-off, which results in estimators embracing convergence rates that are the square root of the corresponding minimax rates. Experimental results on synthetic data are reported to support and demonstrate the statistical properties of our estimators under one-bit quantization.

### The Unfairness of Active Users and Popularity Bias in Point-of-Interest Recommendation. (arXiv:2202.13307v1 [cs.IR])

> ABSTRACT  :  Point-of-Interest (POI) recommender systems provide personalized recommendations to users and help businesses attract potential customers. Despite their success, recent studies suggest that highly data-driven recommendations could be impacted by data biases, resulting in unfair outcomes for different stakeholders, mainly consumers (users) and providers (items). Most existing fairness-related research works in recommender systems treat user fairness and item fairness issues individually, disregarding that RS work in a two-sided marketplace. This paper studies the interplay between (i) the unfairness of active users, (ii) the unfairness of popular items, and (iii) the accuracy (personalization) of recommendation as three angles of our study triangle. We group users into advantaged and disadvantaged levels to measure user fairness based on their activity level. For item fairness, we divide items into short-head, mid-tail, and long-tail groups and study the **exposure** of these item groups into the top-k recommendation list of users. Experimental validation of eight different recommendation models commonly used for POI recommendation (e.g., contextual, CF) on two publicly available POI recommendation datasets, Gowalla and Yelp, indicate that most well-performing models suffer seriously from the unfairness of popularity bias (provider unfairness). Furthermore, our study shows that most recommendation models cannot satisfy both consumer and producer fairness, indicating a trade-off between these variables possibly due to natural biases in data. We choose the POI recommendation as our test scenario; however, the insights should be trivially extendable on other domains.

> ABSTRACT  :  Recent studies have shown that recommendation systems commonly suffer from popularity bias. Popularity bias refers to the problem that popular items (i.e., frequently rated items) are recommended frequently while less popular items are recommended rarely or not at all. Researchers adopted two approaches to examining popularity bias: (i) from the users' perspective, by analyzing how far a recommendation system deviates from user's expectations in receiving popular items, and (ii) by analyzing the amount of **exposure** that long-tail items receive, measured by overall catalog coverage and novelty. In this paper, we examine the first point of view in the book domain, although the findings may be applied to other domains as well. To this end, we analyze the well-known Book-Crossing dataset and define three user groups based on their tendency towards popular items (i.e., Niche, Diverse, Bestseller-focused). Further, we evaluate the performance of nine state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and two baselines (i.e., Random, MostPop) from both the accuracy (e.g., NDCG, Precision, Recall) and popularity bias perspectives. Our results indicate that most state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms suffer from popularity bias in the book domain, and fail to meet users' expectations with Niche and Diverse tastes despite having a larger profile size. Conversely, Bestseller-focused users are more likely to receive high-quality recommendations, both in terms of fairness and personalization. Furthermore, our study shows a tradeoff between personalization and unfairness of popularity bias in recommendation algorithms for users belonging to the Diverse and Bestseller groups, that is, algorithms with high capability of personalization suffer from the unfairness of popularity bias.

> ABSTRACT  :  Semantic maps represent the environment using a set of semantically meaningful objects. This representation is storage-efficient, less ambiguous, and more informative, thus facilitating large-scale autonomy and the acquisition of actionable information in highly unstructured, GPS-denied environments. In this letter, we propose an integrated system that can perform large-scale autonomous flights and real-time semantic mapping in challenging under-canopy environments. We detect and model tree trunks and ground planes from LiDAR data, which are associated across scans and used to constrain robot poses as well as tree trunk models. The autonomous navigation module utilizes a multi-level planning and mapping framework and computes dynamically feasible trajectories that lead the UAV to build a semantic map of the user-defined region of interest in a computationally and storage efficient manner. A drift-compensation mechanism is designed to minimize the odometry drift using semantic SLAM outputs in **real time**, while maintaining planner optimality and controller stability. This leads the UAV to execute its mission accurately and safely at scale. Code is released at: https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_autonomous_flight and https://github.com/KumarRobotics/sloam.
