### Rethinking Surgical Captioning: End-to-End Window-Based MLP Transformer Using Patches. (arXiv:2207.00113v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Surgical captioning plays an important role in surgical instruction prediction and report generation. However, the majority of captioning models still rely on the heavy computational object detector or feature extractor to extract regional features. In addition, the detection model requires additional bounding box annotation which is costly and needs skilled annotators. These lead to inference delay and limit the captioning model to deploy in real-time robotic surgery. For this purpose, we design an end-to-end detector and feature extractor-free captioning model by utilizing the patch-based shifted window technique. We propose Shifted Window-Based Multi-Layer Perceptrons Transformer Captioning model (**Swin**MLP-TranCAP) with faster inference speed and less computation. **Swin**MLP-TranCAP replaces the multi-head attention module with window-based multi-head MLP. Such deployments primarily focus on image understanding tasks, but very few works investigate the caption generation task. **Swin**MLP-TranCAP is also extended into a video version for video captioning tasks using 3D patches and windows. Compared with previous detector-based or feature extractor-based models, our models greatly simplify the architecture design while maintaining performance on two surgical datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/XuMengyaAmy/**Swin**MLP_TranCAP.

> ABSTRACT  :  Edge computing is being widely used for video analytics. To alleviate the inherent tension between accuracy and cost, various video analytics pipelines have been proposed to optimize the usage of GPU on edge nodes. Nonetheless, we find that GPU compute resources provisioned for edge nodes are commonly under-utilized due to video content variations, subsampling and filtering at different places of a pipeline. As opposed to model and pipeline optimization, in this work, we study the problem of opportunistic data **enhancement** using the non-deterministic and fragmented idle GPU resources. In specific, we propose a task-specific discrimination and **enhancement** module and a model-aware adversarial training mechanism, providing a way to identify and transform low-quality images that are specific to a video pipeline in an accurate and efficient manner. A multi-exit model structure and a resource-aware scheduler is further developed to make online **enhancement** decisions and fine-grained inference execution under latency and GPU resource constraints. Experiments across multiple video analytics pipelines and datasets reveal that by judiciously allocating a small amount of idle resources on frames that tend to yield greater marginal benefits from **enhancement**, our system boosts DNN object detection accuracy by $7.3-11.3\%$ without incurring any latency costs.  
### Polarized Color Image Denoising using Pocoformer. (arXiv:2207.00215v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors : Zhuoxiao Li, Haiyang Jiang, Yinqiang Zheng

> ABSTRACT  :  Polarized color photography provides both visual textures and object surficial information in one single snapshot. However, the use of the directional polarizing filter array causes extremely lower photon count and SNR compared to conventional color imaging. Thus, the feature essentially leads to unpleasant noisy images and destroys polarization analysis performance. It is a challenge for traditional image processing pipelines owing to the fact that the physical constraints exerted implicitly in the channels are excessively complicated. To address this issue, we propose a learning-based approach to simultaneously restore clean signals and precise polarization information. A real-world polarized color image dataset of paired raw short-exposed noisy and long-exposed reference images are captured to support the learning-based pipeline. Moreover, we embrace the development of vision Transformer and propose a hybrid transformer model for the Polarized Color image denoising, namely PoCoformer, for a better **restoration** performance. Abundant experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method and key factors that affect results are analyzed.
### Wavelet leader based formalism to compute multifractal features for classifying lung nodules in X-ray images. (arXiv:2207.00262v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Isabella Mar, Angela Mireya, Damian Vald
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00262](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00262)
> ABSTRACT  :  This paper presents and validates a novel lung nodule classification algorithm that uses multifractal features found in X-ray images. The proposed method includes a pre-processing step where two **enhancement** techniques are applied: histogram equalization and a combination of wavelet decomposition and morphological operations. As a novelty, multifractal features using wavelet leader based formalism are used with Support Vector Machine classifier; other classical texture features were also included. Best results were obtained when using multifractal features in combination with classical texture features, with a maximum ROC AUC of 75\%. The results show improvements when using data augmentation technique, and parameter optimization. The proposed method proved to be more efficient and accurate than Modulus Maxima Wavelet Formalism in both computational cost and accuracy when compared in a similar experimental set up.  
### Image Quality Assessment for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. (arXiv:2203.07809v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms aim to reproduce the human's perception of the image quality. The growing popularity of image **enhancement**, generation, and recovery models instigated the development of many methods to assess their performance. However, most IQA solutions are designed to predict image quality in the general domain, with the applicability to specific areas, such as medical imaging, remaining questionable. Moreover, the selection of these IQA metrics for a specific task typically involves intentionally induced distortions, such as manually added noise or artificial blurring; yet, the chosen metrics are then used to judge the output of real-life computer vision models. In this work, we aspire to fill these gaps by carrying out the most extensive IQA evaluation study for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to date (14,700 subjective scores). We use outputs of neural network models trained to solve problems relevant to MRI, including image reconstruction in the scan acceleration, motion correction, and denoising. Our emphasis is on reflecting the radiologist's perception of the reconstructed images, gauging the most diagnostically influential criteria for the quality of MRI scans: signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and the presence of artifacts. Seven trained radiologists assess these distorted images, with their verdicts then correlated with 35 different image quality metrics (full-reference, no-reference, and distribution-based metrics considered). The top performers -- DISTS, HaarPSI, VSI, and FID-VGG16 -- are found to be efficient across three proposed quality criteria, for all considered anatomies and the target tasks.

### High-resolution Solar Image Reconstruction Based on Non-rigid Alignment. (arXiv:2207.00268v1 [astro-ph.IM])

> ABSTRACT  :  Suppressing the interference of atmospheric turbulence and obtaining observation data with a high spatial resolution is an issue to be solved urgently for ground observations. One way to solve this problem is to perform a statistical reconstruction of short-**exposure** speckle images. Combining the rapidity of Shift-Add and the accuracy of speckle masking, this paper proposes a novel reconstruction algorithm-NASIR (Non-rigid Alignment based Solar Image Reconstruction). NASIR reconstructs the phase of the object image at each frequency by building a computational model between geometric distortion and intensity distribution and reconstructs the modulus of the object image on the aligned speckle images by speckle interferometry. We analyzed the performance of NASIR by using the correlation coefficient, power spectrum, and coefficient of variation of intensity profile (CVoIP) in processing data obtained by the NVST (1m New Vacuum Solar Telescope). The reconstruction experiments and analysis results show that the quality of images reconstructed by NASIR is close to speckle masking when the seeing is good, while NASIR has excellent robustness when the seeing condition becomes worse. Furthermore, NASIR reconstructs the entire field of view in parallel in one go, without phase recursion and block-by-block reconstruction, so its computation time is less than half that of speckle masking. Therefore, we consider NASIR is a robust and high-quality fast reconstruction method that can serve as an effective tool for data filtering and quick look.  
### Task-specific Performance Prediction and Acquisition Optimization for Anisotropic X-ray **Dark**-field Tomography. (arXiv:2207.00332v1 [physics.med-ph])
- Authors : Theodor Cheslerean, Franz Pfeiffer, Tobias Lasser
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00332](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00332)
> ABSTRACT  :  Anisotropic X-ray **Dark**-field Tomography (AXDT) is a recently developed imaging modality that enables the visualization of oriented microstructures using lab-based X-ray grating interferometer setups. While there are very promising application scenarios, for example in materials testing of fibrous composites or in medical diagnosis of brain cell connectivity, AXDT faces challenges in practical applicability due to the complex and time-intensive acquisitions required to fully sample the anisotropic X-ray scattering functions. However, depending on the specific imaging task at hand, a full sampling may not be required, allowing for reduced acquisitions. In this work we are investigating a performance prediction approach for AXDT using task-specific detectability indices. Based on this approach we present a task-driven acquisition optimization method that enables reduced acquisition schemes while keeping the task-specific image quality high. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the method in experiments with simulated and experimental data.

### DarK**night**: An Accelerated Framework for Privacy and Integrity Preserving Deep Learning Using Trusted Hardware. (arXiv:2207.00083v1 [cs.CR])
- Authors : Hanieh Hashemi, Yongqin Wang, Murali Annavaram
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00083](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00083)
> ABSTRACT  :  Privacy and security-related concerns are growing as machine learning reaches diverse application domains. The data holders want to train or infer with private data while exploiting accelerators, such as GPUs, that are hosted in the cloud. Cloud systems are vulnerable to attackers that compromise the privacy of data and integrity of computations. Tackling such a challenge requires unifying theoretical privacy algorithms with hardware security capabilities. This paper presents DarK**night**, a framework for large DNN training while protecting input privacy and computation integrity. DarK**night** relies on cooperative execution between trusted execution environments (TEE) and accelerators, where the TEE provides privacy and integrity verification, while accelerators perform the bulk of the linear algebraic computation to optimize the performance. In particular, DarK**night** uses a customized data encoding strategy based on matrix masking to create input obfuscation within a TEE. The obfuscated data is then offloaded to GPUs for fast linear algebraic computation. DarK**night**'s data obfuscation strategy provides provable data privacy and computation integrity in the cloud servers. While prior works tackle inference privacy and cannot be utilized for training, DarK**night**'s encoding scheme is designed to support both training and inference.  
### Improving Speech **Enhancement** through Fine-Grained Speech Characteristics. (arXiv:2207.00237v1 [cs.SD])
- Authors : Muqiao Yang, Joseph Konan, David Bick, Anurag Kumar, Shinji Watanabe, Bhiksha Raj
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00237](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00237)
> ABSTRACT  :  While deep learning based speech **enhancement** systems have made rapid progress in improving the quality of speech signals, they can still produce outputs that contain artifacts and can sound unnatural. We propose a novel approach to speech **enhancement** aimed at improving perceptual quality and naturalness of enhanced signals by optimizing for key characteristics of speech. We first identify key acoustic parameters that have been found to correlate well with voice quality (e.g. jitter, shimmer, and spectral flux) and then propose objective functions which are aimed at reducing the difference between clean speech and enhanced speech with respect to these features. The full set of acoustic features is the extended Geneva Acoustic Parameter Set (eGeMAPS), which includes 25 different attributes associated with perception of speech. Given the non-differentiable nature of these feature computation, we first build differentiable estimators of the eGeMAPS and then use them to fine-tune existing speech **enhancement** systems. Our approach is generic and can be applied to any existing deep learning based **enhancement** systems to further improve the enhanced speech signals. Experimental results conducted on the Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) Challenge dataset shows that our approach can improve the state-of-the-art deep learning based **enhancement** systems.  
### CRISP: A Probabilistic Model for Individual-Level COVID-19 Infection Risk Estimation Based on Contact Data. (arXiv:2006.04942v2 [cs.SI] UPDATED)
- Authors : Ralf Herbrich, Rajeev Rastogi, Roland Vollgraf
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04942](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04942)
> ABSTRACT  :  We present CRISP (COVID-19 Risk Score Prediction), a probabilistic graphical model for COVID-19 infection spread through a population based on the SEIR model where we assume access to (1) mutual contacts between pairs of individuals across time across various channels (e.g., Bluetooth contact traces), as well as (2) test outcomes at given times for infection, **exposure** and immunity tests. Our micro-level model keeps track of the infection state for each individual at every point in time, ranging from susceptible, exposed, infectious to recovered. We develop both a Monte Carlo EM as well as a message passing algorithm to infer contact-channel specific infection transmission probabilities. Our Monte Carlo algorithm uses Gibbs sampling to draw samples of the latent infection status of each individual over the entire time period of analysis, given the latent infection status of all contacts and test outcome data. Experimental results with simulated data demonstrate our CRISP model can be parametrized by the reproduction factor $R_0$ and exhibits population-level infectiousness and recovery time series similar to those of the classical SEIR model. However, due to the individual contact data, this model allows fine grained control and inference for a wide range of COVID-19 mitigation and suppression policy measures. Moreover, the block-Gibbs sampling algorithm is able to support efficient testing in a test-trace-isolate approach to contain COVID-19 infection spread. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model with efficient inference for COVID-19 infection spread based on individual-level contact data; most epidemic models are macro-level models that reason over entire populations. The implementation of CRISP is available in Python and C++ at https://github.com/zalandoresearch/CRISP.  
### Receptive Field Analysis of Temporal Convolutional Networks for Monaural Speech Dereverberation. (arXiv:2204.06439v3 [cs.SD] UPDATED)
- Authors : William Ravenscroft, Stefan Goetze, Thomas Hain

> ABSTRACT  :  Speech dereverberation is often an important requirement in robust speech processing tasks. Supervised deep learning (DL) models give state-of-the-art performance for single-channel speech dereverberation. Temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) are commonly used for sequence modelling in speech **enhancement** tasks. A feature of TCNs is that they have a receptive field (RF) dependent on the specific model configuration which determines the number of input frames that can be observed to produce an individual output frame. It has been shown that TCNs are capable of performing dereverberation of simulated speech data, however a thorough analysis, especially with focus on the RF is yet lacking in the literature. This paper analyses dereverberation performance depending on the model size and the RF of TCNs. Experiments using the WHAMR corpus which is extended to include room impulse responses (RIRs) with larger T60 values demonstrate that a larger RF can have significant improvement in performance when training smaller TCN models. It is also demonstrated that TCNs benefit from a wider RF when dereverberating RIRs with larger RT60 values.  
### Risk Perspective Exploration in Distributional Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2206.14170v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)
- Authors : Jihwan Oh, Joonkee Kim, Young Yun
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14170](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14170)
> ABSTRACT  :  Distributional reinforcement learning demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in continuous and discrete control settings with the features of variance and risk, which can be used to explore. However, the exploration method employing the risk property is hard to find, although numerous exploration methods in Distributional RL employ the variance of return distribution per action. In this paper, we present risk scheduling approaches that explore risk levels and optimistic behaviors from a risk perspective. We demonstrate the performance **enhancement** of the DMIX algorithm using risk scheduling in a multi-agent setting with comprehensive experiments.
