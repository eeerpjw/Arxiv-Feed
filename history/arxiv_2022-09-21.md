### QuestSim: Human Motion Tracking from Sparse Sensors with Simulated Avatars. (arXiv:2209.09391v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  **Real-time** tracking of human body motion is crucial for interactive and immersive experiences in AR/VR. However, very limited sensor data about the body is available from standalone wearable devices such as HMDs (Head Mounted Devices) or AR glasses. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning framework that takes in sparse signals from an HMD and two controllers, and simulates plausible and physically valid full body motions. Using high quality full body motion as dense supervision during training, a simple policy network can learn to output appropriate torques for the character to balance, walk, and jog, while closely following the input signals. Our results demonstrate surprisingly similar leg motions to ground truth without any observations of the lower body, even when the input is only the 6D transformations of the HMD. We also show that a single policy can be robust to diverse locomotion styles, different body sizes, and novel environments.  
### BuFF: Burst Feature Finder for Light-Constrained 3D Reconstruction. (arXiv:2209.09470v1 [cs.RO])

> ABSTRACT  :  Robots operating at **night** using conventional vision cameras face significant challenges in reconstruction due to noise-limited images. Previous work has demonstrated that burst-imaging techniques can be used to partially overcome this issue. In this paper, we develop a novel feature detector that operates directly on image bursts that enhances vision-based reconstruction under extremely **low-light** conditions. Our approach finds keypoints with well-defined scale and apparent motion within each burst by jointly searching in a multi-scale and multi-motion space. Because we describe these features at a stage where the images have higher signal-to-noise ratio, the detected features are more accurate than the state-of-the-art on conventional noisy images and burst-merged images and exhibit high precision, recall, and matching performance. We show improved feature performance and camera pose estimates and demonstrate improved structure-from-motion performance using our feature detector in challenging light-constrained scenes. Our feature finder provides a significant step towards robots operating in **low-light** scenarios and applications including **night**-time operations.

> ABSTRACT  :  3D point clouds can flexibly represent continuous surfaces and can be used for various applications; however, the lack of structural information makes point cloud recognition challenging. Recent edge-aware methods mainly use edge information as an extra feature that describes local structures to facilitate learning. Although these methods show that incorporating edges into the network design is beneficial, they generally lack interpretability, making users wonder how exactly edges help. To shed light on this issue, in this study, we propose the Diffusion Unit (DU) that handles edges in an interpretable manner while providing decent improvement. Our method is interpretable in three ways. First, we theoretically show that DU learns to perform task-beneficial edge **enhancement** and suppression. Second, we experimentally observe and verify the edge **enhancement** and suppression behavior. Third, we empirically demonstrate that this behavior contributes to performance improvement. Extensive experiments performed on challenging benchmarks verify the superiority of DU in terms of both interpretability and performance gain. Specifically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in object part segmentation using ShapeNet part and scene segmentation using S3DIS. Our source code will be released at https://github.com/martianxiu/DiffusionUnit.

> ABSTRACT  :  Digital humans are attracting more and more research interest during the last decade, the generation, representation, rendering, and animation of which have been put into large amounts of effort. However, the quality assessment for digital humans has fallen behind. Therefore, to tackle the challenge of digital human quality assessment issues, we propose the first large-scale quality assessment database for scanned digital human heads (DHHs). The constructed database consists of 55 reference DHHs and 1,540 distorted DHHs along with the subjective ratings. Then, a simple yet effective full-reference (FR) projection-based method is proposed. The pretrained **Swin** Transformer tiny is employed for hierarchical feature extraction and the multi-head attention module is utilized for feature fusion. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art performance among the mainstream FR metrics. The database and the method presented in this work will be made publicly available.  
### NBD-GAP: Non-Blind Image Deblurring Without Clean Target Images. (arXiv:2209.09498v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Nithin Gopalakrishnan, Rajeev Yasarla
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09498](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09498)
> ABSTRACT  :  In recent years, deep neural network-based **restoration** methods have achieved state-of-the-art results in various image deblurring tasks. However, one major drawback of deep learning-based deblurring networks is that large amounts of blurry-clean image pairs are required for training to achieve good performance. Moreover, deep networks often fail to perform well when the blurry images and the blur kernels during testing are very different from the ones used during training. This happens mainly because of the overfitting of the network parameters on the training data. In this work, we present a method that addresses these issues. We view the non-blind image deblurring problem as a denoising problem. To do so, we perform Wiener filtering on a pair of blurry images with the corresponding blur kernels. This results in a pair of images with colored noise. Hence, the deblurring problem is translated into a denoising problem. We then solve the denoising problem without using explicit clean target images. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that our method achieves results that are on par to the state-of-the-art non-blind deblurring works.  
### An Outlier **Exposure** Approach to Improve Visual Anomaly Detection Performance for Mobile Robots. (arXiv:2209.09786v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Dario Mantegazza, Alessandro Giusti, Luca Maria, me Guzzi
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09786](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09786)
> ABSTRACT  :  We consider the problem of building visual anomaly detection systems for mobile robots. Standard anomaly detection models are trained using large datasets composed only of non-anomalous data. However, in robotics applications, it is often the case that (potentially very few) examples of anomalies are available. We tackle the problem of exploiting these data to improve the performance of a Real-NVP anomaly detection model, by minimizing, jointly with the Real-NVP loss, an auxiliary outlier **exposure** margin loss. We perform quantitative experiments on a novel dataset (which we publish as supplementary material) designed for anomaly detection in an indoor patrolling scenario. On a disjoint test set, our approach outperforms alternatives and shows that exposing even a small number of anomalous frames yields significant performance improvements.  
### Enhancing vehicle detection accuracy in thermal infrared images using multiple GANs. (arXiv:2209.09808v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Shivom Bhargava, Pranamesh Chakraborty
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09808](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09808)
> ABSTRACT  :  Vehicle detection accuracy is fairly accurate in good-illumination conditions but susceptible to poor detection accuracy under **low-light** conditions. The combined effect of **low-light** and glare from vehicle headlight or tail-light results in misses in vehicle detection more likely by state-of-the-art object detection models. However, thermal infrared images are robust to illumination changes and are based on thermal radiations. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been extensively used in image domain transfer tasks. State-of-the-art GAN models have attempted to improve vehicle detection accuracy in **night**-time by converting infrared images to day-time RGB images. However, these models have been found to under-perform during **night**-time conditions compared to day-time conditions. Therefore, this study attempts to alleviate this shortcoming by proposing three different approaches based on combination of GAN models at two different levels that tries to reduce the feature distribution gap between day-time and **night**-time infrared images. Quantitative analysis to compare the performance of the proposed models with the state-of-the-art models have been done by testing the models using state-of-the-art object detection models. Both the quantitative and qualitative analyses have shown that the proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art GAN models for vehicle detection in **night**-time conditions, showing the efficacy of the proposed models.  
### Text2Light: Zero-Shot Text-Driven **HDR** Panorama Generation. (arXiv:2209.09898v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  High-quality **HDR**Is(**High Dynamic Range** Images), typically **HDR** panoramas, are one of the most popular ways to create photorealistic lighting and 360-degree reflections of 3D scenes in graphics. Given the difficulty of capturing **HDR**Is, a versatile and controllable generative model is highly desired, where layman users can intuitively control the generation process. However, existing state-of-the-art methods still struggle to synthesize high-quality panoramas for complex scenes. In this work, we propose a zero-shot text-driven framework, Text2Light, to generate 4K+ resolution **HDR**Is without paired training data. Given a free-form text as the description of the scene, we synthesize the corresponding **HDR**I with two dedicated steps: 1) text-driven panorama generation in low dynamic range(LDR) and low resolution, and 2) super-resolution inverse tone mapping to scale up the LDR panorama both in resolution and dynamic range. Specifically, to achieve zero-shot text-driven panorama generation, we first build dual codebooks as the discrete representation for diverse environmental textures. Then, driven by the pre-trained CLIP model, a text-conditioned global sampler learns to sample holistic semantics from the global codebook according to the input text. Furthermore, a structure-aware local sampler learns to synthesize LDR panoramas patch-by-patch, guided by holistic semantics. To achieve super-resolution inverse tone mapping, we derive a continuous representation of 360-degree imaging from the LDR panorama as a set of structured latent codes anchored to the sphere. This continuous representation enables a versatile module to upscale the resolution and dynamic range simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior capability of Text2Light in generating high-quality **HDR** panoramas. In addition, we show the feasibility of our work in realistic rendering and immersive VR.  
### Refign: Align and Refine for Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation to Adverse Conditions. (arXiv:2207.06825v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : David Bruggemann, Christos Sakaridis, Prune Truong, Luc Van
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06825](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06825)
> ABSTRACT  :  Due to the scarcity of dense pixel-level semantic annotations for images recorded in adverse visual conditions, there has been a keen interest in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for the semantic segmentation of such images. UDA adapts models trained on normal conditions to the target adverse-condition domains. Meanwhile, multiple datasets with driving scenes provide corresponding images of the same scenes across multiple conditions, which can serve as a form of weak supervision for domain adaptation. We propose Refign, a generic extension to self-training-based UDA methods which leverages these cross-domain correspondences. Refign consists of two steps: (1) aligning the normal-condition image to the corresponding adverse-condition image using an uncertainty-aware dense matching network, and (2) refining the adverse prediction with the normal prediction using an adaptive label correction mechanism. We design custom modules to streamline both steps and set the new state of the art for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on several adverse-condition benchmarks, including ACDC and **Dark** Zurich. The approach introduces no extra training parameters, minimal computational overhead -- during training only -- and can be used as a drop-in extension to improve any given self-training-based UDA method. Code is available at https://github.com/brdav/refign.
