> ABSTRACT  :  Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a high-resolution functional imaging modality that can non-invasively access a broad range of pathophysiological phenomena by quantifying the contrast of endogenous chromophores in tissue. **Real-time** imaging is imperative to translate MSOT into clinical imaging, visualize dynamic pathophysiological changes associated with disease progression, and enable in situ diagnoses. Model-based reconstruction affords state-of-the-art optoacoustic images; however, the advanced image quality provided by model-based reconstruction remains inaccessible during real-time imaging because the algorithm is iterative and computationally demanding. Deep-learning may afford faster reconstructions for real-time optoacoustic imaging, but existing approaches only support oversimplified imaging settings and fail to generalize to in vivo data. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework, termed DeepMB, to learn the model-based reconstruction operator and infer optoacoustic images with state-of-the-art quality in less than 10 ms per image. DeepMB accurately generalizes to in vivo data after training on synthesized sinograms that are derived from real-world images. The framework affords in-focus images for a broad range of anatomical locations because it supports dynamic adjustment of the reconstruction speed of sound during imaging. Furthermore, DeepMB is compatible with the data rates and image sizes of modern multispectral optoacoustic tomography scanners. We evaluate DeepMB on a diverse dataset of in vivo images and demonstrate that the framework reconstructs images 3000 times faster than the iterative model-based reference method while affording near-identical image qualities. Accurate and real-time image reconstructions with DeepMB can enable full access to the high-resolution and multispectral contrast of handheld optoacoustic tomography.

### On the Difficulty of Defending Self-Supervised Learning against Model Extraction. (arXiv:2205.07890v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is an increasingly popular ML paradigm that trains models to transform complex inputs into representations without relying on explicit labels. These representations encode similarity structures that enable efficient learning of multiple downstream tasks. Recently, ML-as-a-Service providers have commenced offering trained SSL models over inference APIs, which transform user inputs into useful representations for a fee. However, the high cost involved to train these models and their **exposure** over APIs both make black-box extraction a realistic security threat. We thus explore model stealing attacks against SSL. Unlike traditional model extraction on classifiers that output labels, the victim models here output representations; these representations are of significantly higher dimensionality compared to the low-dimensional prediction scores output by classifiers. We construct several novel attacks and find that approaches that train directly on a victim's stolen representations are query efficient and enable high accuracy for downstream models. We then show that existing defenses against model extraction are inadequate and not easily retrofitted to the specificities of SSL.

### Collaborative Navigation and Manipulation of a Cable-towed Load by Multiple Quadrupedal Robots. (arXiv:2206.14424v1 [cs.RO])

> ABSTRACT  :  This paper tackles the problem of robots collaboratively towing a load with cables to a specified goal location while avoiding collisions in **real time**. The introduction of cables (as opposed to rigid links) enables the robotic team to travel through narrow spaces by changing its intrinsic dimensions through slack/taut switches of the cable. However, this is a challenging problem because of the hybrid mode switches and the dynamical coupling among multiple robots and the load. Previous attempts at addressing such a problem were performed offline and do not consider avoiding obstacles online. In this paper, we introduce a cascaded planning scheme with a parallelized centralized trajectory optimization that deals with hybrid mode switches. We additionally develop a set of decentralized planners per robot, which enables our approach to solve the problem of collaborative load manipulation online. We develop and demonstrate one of the first collaborative autonomy framework that is able to move a cable-towed load, which is too heavy to move by a single robot, through narrow spaces with real-time feedback and reactive planning in experiments.  
### Deep Active Visual Attention for **Real-time** Robot Motion Generation: Emergence of Tool-body Assimilation and Adaptive Tool-use. (arXiv:2206.14530v1 [cs.RO])

> ABSTRACT  :  Sufficiently perceiving the environment is a critical factor in robot motion generation. Although the introduction of deep visual processing models have contributed in extending this ability, existing methods lack in the ability to actively modify what to perceive; humans perform internally during visual cognitive processes. This paper addresses the issue by proposing a novel robot motion generation model, inspired by a human cognitive structure. The model incorporates a state-driven active top-down visual attention module, which acquires attentions that can actively change targets based on task states. We term such attentions as role-based attentions, since the acquired attention directed to targets that shared a coherent role throughout the motion. The model was trained on a robot tool-use task, in which the role-based attentions perceived the robot grippers and tool as identical end-effectors, during object picking and object dragging motions respectively. This is analogous to a biological phenomenon called tool-body assimilation, in which one regards a handled tool as an extension of one's body. The results suggested an improvement of flexibility in model's visual perception, which sustained stable attention and motion even if it was provided with untrained tools or exposed to experimenter's distractions.
