> ABSTRACT  :  Images acquired during underwater activities suffer from environmental properties of the water, such as turbidity and light attenuation. These phenomena cause color distortion, blurring, and contrast reduction. In addition, irregular ambient light distribution causes color channel unbalance and regions with high-intensity pixels. Recent works related to underwater image **enhancement**, and based on deep learning approaches, tackle the lack of paired datasets generating synthetic ground-truth. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning methodology for underwater image **enhancement** based on deep learning that requires no paired datasets. The proposed method estimates the degradation present in underwater images. Besides, an autoencoder reconstructs this image, and its output image is degraded using the estimated degradation information. Therefore, the strategy replaces the output image with the degraded version in the loss function during the training phase. This procedure \textit{misleads} the neural network that learns to compensate the additional degradation. As a result, the reconstructed image is an enhanced version of the input image. Also, the algorithm presents an attention module to reduce high-intensity areas generated in enhanced images by color channel unbalances and outlier regions. Furthermore, the proposed methodology requires no ground-truth. Besides, only real underwater images were used to train the neural network, and the results indicate the effectiveness of the method in terms of color preservation, color cast reduction, and contrast improvement.

> ABSTRACT  :  Uncalibrated photometric stereo is proposed to estimate the detailed surface normal from images under varying and unknown lightings. Recently, deep learning brings powerful data priors to this underdetermined problem. This paper presents a new method for deep uncalibrated photometric stereo, which efficiently utilizes the inter-image representation to guide the normal estimation. Previous methods use optimization-based neural inverse rendering or a single size-independent pooling layer to deal with multiple inputs, which are inefficient for utilizing information among input images. Given multi-images under different lighting, we consider the intra-image and inter-image variations highly correlated. Motivated by the correlated variations, we designed an inter-intra image feature fusion module to introduce the inter-image representation into the per-image feature extraction. The extra representation is used to guide the per-image feature extraction and eliminate the ambiguity in normal estimation. We demonstrate the effect of our design on a wide range of samples, especially on **dark** materials. Our method produces significantly better results than the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real data.

> ABSTRACT  :  Existing 3D skeleton-based action recognition approaches reach impressive performance by encoding handcrafted action features to image format and decoding by CNNs. However, such methods are limited in two ways: a) the handcrafted action features are difficult to handle challenging actions, and b) they generally require complex CNN models to improve action recognition accuracy, which usually occur heavy computational burden. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel AFE-CNN, which devotes to enhance the features of 3D skeleton-based actions to adapt to challenging actions. We propose feature enhance modules from key joint, bone vector, key frame and temporal perspectives, thus the AFE-CNN is more robust to camera views and body sizes variation, and significantly improve the recognition accuracy on challenging actions. Moreover, our AFE-CNN adopts a light-weight CNN model to decode images with action feature enhanced, which ensures a much lower computational burden than the state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate the AFE-CNN on three benchmark skeleton-based action datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and UTKinect-Action3D, with extensive experimental results demonstrate our outstanding performance of AFE-CNN.

> ABSTRACT  :  Two-stage detectors have gained much popularity in 3D object detection. Most two-stage 3D detectors utilize grid points, voxel grids, or sampled keypoints for RoI feature extraction in the second stage. Such methods, however, are inefficient in handling unevenly distributed and sparse outdoor points. This paper solves this problem in three aspects. 1) Dynamic Point Aggregation. We propose the patch search to quickly search points in a local region for each 3D proposal. The dynamic farthest voxel sampling is then applied to evenly sample the points. Especially, the voxel size varies along the distance to accommodate the uneven distribution of points. 2) RoI-graph Pooling. We build local graphs on the sampled points to better model contextual information and mine point relations through iterative message passing. 3) Visual Features Augmentation. We introduce a simple yet effective fusion strategy to compensate for sparse LiDAR points with limited semantic cues. Based on these modules, we construct our Graph R-CNN as the second stage, which can be applied to existing one-stage detectors to consistently improve the detection performance. Extensive experiments show that Graph R-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D detection models by a large margin on both the KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset. And we rank first place on the KITTI BEV car detection leaderboard. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/**Night**mare-n/GraphRCNN}.

> ABSTRACT  :  Considerable progress has been made in domain generalization (DG) which aims to learn a generalizable model from multiple well-annotated source domains to unknown target domains. However, it can be prohibitively expensive to obtain sufficient annotation for source datasets in many real scenarios. To escape from the dilemma between domain generalization and annotation costs, in this paper, we introduce a novel task named label-efficient domain generalization (LEDG) to enable model generalization with label-limited source domains. To address this challenging task, we propose a novel framework called Collaborative Exploration and Generalization (CEG) which jointly optimizes active exploration and semi-supervised generalization. Specifically, in active exploration, to explore class and domain discriminability while avoiding information divergence and redundancy, we query the labels of the samples with the highest overall ranking of class uncertainty, domain representativeness, and information diversity. In semi-supervised generalization, we design MixUp-based intra- and inter-domain knowledge augmentation to expand domain knowledge and generalize domain invariance. We unify active exploration and semi-supervised generalization in a collaborative way and promote mutual **enhancement** between them, boosting model generalization with limited annotation. Extensive experiments show that CEG yields superior generalization performance. In particular, CEG can even use only 5% data annotation budget to achieve competitive results compared to the previous DG methods with fully labeled data on PACS dataset.  
### Robust Multi-Object Tracking by Marginal Inference. (arXiv:2208.03727v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Multi-object tracking in videos requires to solve a fundamental problem of one-to-one assignment between objects in adjacent frames. Most methods address the problem by first discarding impossible pairs whose feature distances are larger than a threshold, followed by linking objects using Hungarian algorithm to minimize the overall distance. However, we find that the distribution of the distances computed from Re-ID features may vary significantly for different videos. So there isn't a single optimal threshold which allows us to safely discard impossible pairs. To address the problem, we present an efficient approach to compute a marginal probability for each pair of objects in **real time**. The marginal probability can be regarded as a normalized distance which is significantly more stable than the original feature distance. As a result, we can use a single threshold for all videos. The approach is general and can be applied to the existing trackers to obtain about one point improvement in terms of IDF1 metric. It achieves competitive results on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks. In addition, the computed probability is more interpretable which facilitates subsequent post-processing operations.  
### PS-NeRV: Patch-wise Stylized Neural Representations for Videos. (arXiv:2208.03742v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  We study how to represent a video with **implicit neural representation**s (INRs). Classical INRs methods generally utilize MLPs to map input coordinates to output pixels. While some recent works have tried to directly reconstruct the whole image with CNNs. However, we argue that both the above pixel-wise and image-wise strategies are not favorable to video data. Instead, we propose a patch-wise solution, PS-NeRV, which represents videos as a function of patches and the corresponding patch coordinate. It naturally inherits the advantages of image-wise methods, and achieves excellent reconstruction performance with fast decoding speed. The whole method includes conventional modules, like positional embedding, MLPs and CNNs, while also introduces AdaIN to enhance intermediate features. These simple yet essential changes could help the network easily fit high-frequency details. Extensive experiments have demonstrated its effectiveness in several video-related tasks, such as video compression and video inpainting.

> ABSTRACT  :  Commercial depth sensors usually generate noisy and missing depths, especially on specular and transparent objects, which poses critical issues to downstream depth or point cloud-based tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose a powerful RGBD fusion network, **Swin**DRNet, for depth **restoration**. We further propose Domain Randomization-Enhanced Depth Simulation (DREDS) approach to simulate an active stereo depth system using physically based rendering and generate a large-scale synthetic dataset that contains 130K photorealistic RGB images along with their simulated depths carrying realistic sensor noises. To evaluate depth **restoration** methods, we also curate a real-world dataset, namely STD, that captures 30 cluttered scenes composed of 50 objects with different materials from specular, transparent, to diffuse. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed DREDS dataset bridges the sim-to-real domain gap such that, trained on DREDS, our **Swin**DRNet can seamlessly generalize to other real depth datasets, e.g. ClearGrasp, and outperform the competing methods on depth **restoration** with a real-time speed. We further show that our depth **restoration** effectively boosts the performance of downstream tasks, including category-level pose estimation and grasping tasks. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/PKU-EPIC/DREDS  
### Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation via Random Amplitude Mixup and Domain-Specific Image **Restoration**. (arXiv:2208.03901v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Ziqi Zhou, Lei Qi, Yinghuan Shi
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03901](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03901)
> ABSTRACT  :  For medical image analysis, segmentation models trained on one or several domains lack generalization ability to unseen domains due to discrepancies between different data acquisition policies. We argue that the degeneration in segmentation performance is mainly attributed to overfitting to source domains and domain shift. To this end, we present a novel generalizable medical image segmentation method. To be specific, we design our approach as a multi-task paradigm by combining the segmentation model with a self-supervision domain-specific image **restoration** (DSIR) module for model regularization. We also design a random amplitude mixup (RAM) module, which incorporates low-level frequency information of different domain images to synthesize new images. To guide our model be resistant to domain shift, we introduce a semantic consistency loss. We demonstrate the performance of our method on two public generalizable segmentation benchmarks in medical images, which validates our method could achieve the state-of-the-art performance.  
### Event Based, Near Eye Gaze Tracking Beyond 10,000Hz. (arXiv:2004.03577v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  The cameras in modern gaze-tracking systems suffer from fundamental bandwidth and power limitations, constraining data acquisition speed to 300 Hz realistically. This obstructs the use of mobile eye trackers to perform, e.g., low latency predictive rendering, or to study quick and subtle eye motions like microsaccades using head-mounted devices in the wild. Here, we propose a hybrid frame-event-based near-eye gaze tracking system offering update rates beyond 10,000 Hz with an accuracy that matches that of high-end desktop-mounted commercial trackers when evaluated in the same conditions. Our system builds on emerging event cameras that simultaneously acquire regularly sampled frames and adaptively sampled events. We develop an online 2D pupil fitting method that updates a parametric model every one or few events. Moreover, we propose a polynomial regressor for estimating the point of gaze from the parametric pupil model in **real time**. Using the first event-based gaze dataset, available at https://github.com/aangelopoulos/event_based_gaze_tracking , we demonstrate that our system achieves accuracies of 0.45 degrees--1.75 degrees for fields of view from 45 degrees to 98 degrees. With this technology, we hope to enable a new generation of ultra-low-latency gaze-contingent rendering and display techniques for virtual and augmented reality.  
### Pixel-wise Energy-biased Abstention Learning for Anomaly Segmentation on Complex Urban Driving Scenes. (arXiv:2111.12264v4 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  State-of-the-art (SOTA) anomaly segmentation approaches on complex urban driving scenes explore pixel-wise classification uncertainty learned from outlier **exposure**, or external reconstruction models. However, previous uncertainty approaches that directly associate high uncertainty to anomaly may sometimes lead to incorrect anomaly predictions, and external reconstruction models tend to be too inefficient for real-time self-driving embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly segmentation method, named pixel-wise energy-biased abstention learning (PEBAL), that explores pixel-wise abstention learning (AL) with a model that learns an adaptive pixel-level anomaly class, and an energy-based model (EBM) that learns inlier pixel distribution. More specifically, PEBAL is based on a non-trivial joint training of EBM and AL, where EBM is trained to output high-energy for anomaly pixels (from outlier **exposure**) and AL is trained such that these high-energy pixels receive adaptive low penalty for being included to the anomaly class. We extensively evaluate PEBAL against the SOTA and show that it achieves the best performance across four benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/tianyu0207/PEBAL.

> ABSTRACT  :  Manipulating volumetric deformable objects in the real world, like plush toys and pizza dough, bring substantial challenges due to infinite shape variations, non-rigid motions, and partial observability. We introduce ACID, an action-conditional visual dynamics model for volumetric deformable objects based on structured **implicit neural representation**s. ACID integrates two new techniques: implicit representations for action-conditional dynamics and geodesics-based contrastive learning. To represent deformable dynamics from partial RGB-D observations, we learn implicit representations of occupancy and flow-based forward dynamics. To accurately identify state change under large non-rigid deformations, we learn a correspondence embedding field through a novel geodesics-based contrastive loss. To evaluate our approach, we develop a simulation framework for manipulating complex deformable shapes in realistic scenes and a benchmark containing over 17,000 action trajectories with six types of plush toys and 78 variants. Our model achieves the best performance in geometry, correspondence, and dynamics predictions over existing approaches. The ACID dynamics models are successfully employed to goal-conditioned deformable manipulation tasks, resulting in a 30% increase in task success rate over the strongest baseline. Furthermore, we apply the simulation-trained ACID model directly to real-world objects and show success in manipulating them into target configurations.

### Adversarial Pixel **Restoration** as a Pretext Task for Transferable Perturbations. (arXiv:2207.08803v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Transferable adversarial attacks optimize adversaries from a pretrained surrogate model and known label space to fool the unknown black-box models. Therefore, these attacks are restricted by the availability of an effective surrogate model. In this work, we relax this assumption and propose Adversarial Pixel **Restoration** as a self-supervised alternative to train an effective surrogate model from scratch under the condition of no labels and few data samples. Our training approach is based on a min-max scheme which reduces overfitting via an adversarial objective and thus optimizes for a more generalizable surrogate model. Our proposed attack is complimentary to the adversarial pixel **restoration** and is independent of any task specific objective as it can be launched in a self-supervised manner. We successfully demonstrate the adversarial transferability of our approach to Vision Transformers as well as Convolutional Neural Networks for the tasks of classification, object detection, and video segmentation. Our training approach improves the transferability of the baseline unsupervised training method by 16.4% on ImageNet val. set. Our codes &amp; pre-trained surrogate models are available at: https://github.com/HashmatShadab/APR

> ABSTRACT  :  Neural Radiance Fields (**NeRF**s) have demonstrated amazing ability to synthesize images of 3D scenes from novel views. However, they rely upon specialized volumetric rendering algorithms based on ray marching that are mismatched to the capabilities of widely deployed graphics hardware. This paper introduces a new **NeRF** representation based on textured polygons that can synthesize novel images efficiently with standard rendering pipelines. The **NeRF** is represented as a set of polygons with textures representing binary opacities and feature vectors. Traditional rendering of the polygons with a z-buffer yields an image with features at every pixel, which are interpreted by a small, view-dependent MLP running in a fragment shader to produce a final pixel color. This approach enables **NeRF**s to be rendered with the traditional polygon rasterization pipeline, which provides massive pixel-level parallelism, achieving interactive frame rates on a wide range of compute platforms, including mobile phones.  
### BATMAN: **Bilateral** Attention Transformer in Motion-Appearance Neighboring Space for Video Object Segmentation. (arXiv:2208.01159v4 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is fundamental to video understanding. Transformer-based methods show significant performance improvement on semi-supervised VOS. However, existing work faces challenges segmenting visually similar objects in close proximity of each other. In this paper, we propose a novel **Bilateral** Attention Transformer in Motion-Appearance Neighboring space (BATMAN) for semi-supervised VOS. It captures object motion in the video via a novel optical flow calibration module that fuses the segmentation mask with optical flow estimation to improve within-object optical flow smoothness and reduce noise at object boundaries. This calibrated optical flow is then employed in our novel **bilateral** attention, which computes the correspondence between the query and reference frames in the neighboring **bilateral** space considering both motion and appearance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BATMAN architecture by outperforming all existing state-of-the-art on all four popular VOS benchmarks: Youtube-VOS 2019 (85.0%), Youtube-VOS 2018 (85.3%), DAVIS 2017Val/Testdev (86.2%/82.2%), and DAVIS 2016 (92.5%).

### Chronological Self-Training for Real-Time Speaker Diarization. (arXiv:2208.03393v1 [cs.SD])
- Authors : Dirk Padfield
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03393](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03393)
> ABSTRACT  :  Diarization partitions an audio stream into segments based on the voices of the speakers. **Real-time** diarization systems that include an enrollment step should limit enrollment training samples to reduce user interaction time. Although training on a small number of samples yields poor performance, we show that the accuracy can be improved dramatically using a chronological self-training approach. We studied the tradeoff between training time and classification performance and found that 1 second is sufficient to reach over 95% accuracy. We evaluated on 700 audio conversation files of about 10 minutes each from 6 different languages and demonstrated average diarization error rates as low as 10%.  
### Estimating Topic **Exposure** for Under-Represented Users on Social Media. (arXiv:2208.03796v1 [cs.SI])

> ABSTRACT  :  Online Social Networks (OSNs) facilitate access to a variety of data allowing researchers to analyze users' behavior and develop user behavioral analysis models. These models rely heavily on the observed data which is usually biased due to the participation inequality. This inequality consists of three groups of online users: the lurkers - users that solely consume the content, the engagers - users that contribute little to the content creation, and the contributors - users that are responsible for creating the majority of the online content. Failing to consider the contribution of all the groups while interpreting population-level interests or sentiments may yield biased results. To reduce the bias induced by the contributors, in this work, we focus on highlighting the engagers' contributions in the observed data as they are more likely to contribute when compared to lurkers, and they comprise a bigger population as compared to the contributors. The first step in behavioral analysis of these users is to find the topics they are exposed to but did not engage with. To do so, we propose a novel framework that aids in identifying these users and estimates their topic **exposure**. The **exposure** estimation mechanism is modeled by incorporating behavioral patterns from similar contributors as well as users' demographic and profile information.  
### Data-Driven Discovery of Molecular Photoswitches with Multioutput Gaussian Processes. (arXiv:2008.03226v3 [physics.chem-ph] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Photoswitchable molecules display two or more isomeric forms that may be accessed using light. Separating the electronic absorption bands of these isomers is key to selectively addressing a specific isomer and achieving high photostationary states whilst overall red-shifting the absorption bands serves to limit material damage due to UV-**exposure** and increases penetration depth in photopharmacological applications. Engineering these properties into a system through synthetic design however, remains a challenge. Here, we present a data-driven discovery pipeline for molecular photoswitches underpinned by dataset curation and multitask learning with Gaussian processes. In the prediction of electronic transition wavelengths, we demonstrate that a multioutput Gaussian process (MOGP) trained using labels from four photoswitch transition wavelengths yields the strongest predictive performance relative to single-task models as well as operationally outperforming time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) in terms of the wall-clock time for prediction. We validate our proposed approach experimentally by screening a library of commercially available photoswitchable molecules. Through this screen, we identified several motifs that displayed separated electronic absorption bands of their isomers, exhibited red-shifted absorptions, and are suited for information transfer and photopharmacological applications. Our curated dataset, code, as well as all models are made available at https://github.com/Ryan-Rhys/The-Photoswitch-Dataset

> ABSTRACT  :  Despite their great success, neural networks still remain as black-boxes due to the lack of interpretability. Here we propose a new analyzing method, namely the weight pathway analysis (WPA), to make them transparent. We consider weights in pathways that link neurons longitudinally from input neurons to output neurons, or simply weight pathways, as the basic units for understanding a neural network, and decompose a neural network into a series of subnetworks of such weight pathways. A visualization scheme of the subnetworks is presented that gives longitudinal perspectives of the network like radiographs, making the internal structures of the network visible. Impacts of parameter adjustments or structural changes to the network can be visualized via such radiographs. Characteristic maps are established for subnetworks to characterize the **enhancement** or suppression of the influence of input samples on each output neuron. Using WPA, we discover that neural network store and utilize information in a holographic way, that is, subnetworks encode all training samples in a coherent structure and thus only by investigating the weight pathways can one explore samples stored in the network. Furthermore, with WPA, we reveal fundamental learning modes of a neural network: the linear learning mode and the nonlinear learning mode. The former extracts linearly separable features while the latter extracts linearly inseparable features. The hidden-layer neurons self-organize into different classes for establishing learning modes and for reaching the training goal. The finding of learning modes provides us the theoretical ground for understanding some of the fundamental problems of machine learning, such as the dynamics of learning process, the role of linear and nonlinear neurons, as well as the role of network width and depth.

The ACID dynamics models are successfully employed to goal-conditioned deformable manipulation tasks, resulting in a 30% increase in task success rate over the strongest baseline. Furthermore, we apply the simulation-trained ACID model directly to real-world objects and show success in manipulating them into target configurations.

> ABSTRACT  :  Designing recommendation systems that serve content aligned with time varying preferences requires proper accounting of the feedback effects of recommendations on human behavior and psychological condition. We argue that modeling the influence of recommendations on people's preferences must be grounded in psychologically plausible models. We contribute a methodology for developing grounded dynamic preference models. We demonstrate this method with models that capture three classic effects from the psychology literature: Mere-**Exposure**, Operant Conditioning, and Hedonic Adaptation. We conduct simulation-based studies to show that the psychological models manifest distinct behaviors that can inform system design. Our study has two direct implications for dynamic user modeling in recommendation systems. First, the methodology we outline is broadly applicable for psychologically grounding dynamic preference models. It allows us to critique recent contributions based on their limited discussion of psychological foundation and their implausible predictions. Second, we discuss implications of dynamic preference models for recommendation systems evaluation and design. In an example, we show that engagement and diversity metrics may be unable to capture desirable recommendation system performance.
