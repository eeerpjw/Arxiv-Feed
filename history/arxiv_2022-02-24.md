> ABSTRACT  :  Automatically understanding human behaviour allows household robots to identify the most critical needs and plan how to assist the human according to the current situation. However, the majority of such methods are developed under the assumption that a large amount of labelled training examples is available for all concepts-of-interest. Robots, on the other hand, operate in constantly changing unstructured environments, and need to adapt to novel action categories from very few samples. Methods for data-efficient recognition from body poses increasingly leverage skeleton sequences structured as image-like arrays and then used as input to convolutional neural networks. We look at this paradigm from the perspective of transformer networks, for the first time exploring visual transformers as data-efficient encoders of skeleton movement. In our pipeline, body pose sequences cast as image-like representations are converted into patch embeddings and then passed to a visual transformer backbone optimized with deep metric learning. Inspired by recent success of feature **enhancement** methods in semi-supervised learning, we further introduce ProFormer -- an improved training strategy which uses soft-attention applied on iteratively estimated action category prototypes used to augment the embeddings and compute an auxiliary consistency loss. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for one-shot recognition from body poses, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets and surpassing the best published approach on the challenging NTU-120 one-shot benchmark by 1.84%. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/KPeng9510/ProFormer.

> ABSTRACT  :  We propose a deep visuo-tactile model for realtime estimation of the liquid inside a deformable container in a proprioceptive way.We fuse two sensory modalities, i.e., the raw visual inputs from the RGB camera and the tactile cues from our specific tactile sensor without any extra sensor calibrations.The robotic system is well controlled and adjusted based on the estimation model in **real time**. The main contributions and novelties of our work are listed as follows: 1) Explore a proprioceptive way for liquid volume estimation by developing an end-to-end predictive model with multi-modal convolutional networks, which achieve a high precision with an error of around 2 ml in the experimental validation. 2) Propose a multi-task learning architecture which comprehensively considers the losses from both classification and regression tasks, and comparatively evaluate the performance of each variant on the collected data and actual robotic platform. 3) Utilize the proprioceptive robotic system to accurately serve and control the requested volume of liquid, which is continuously flowing into a deformable container in **real time**. 4) Adaptively adjust the grasping plan to achieve more stable grasping and manipulation according to the real-time liquid volume prediction.  
### CycleMLP: A MLP-like Architecture for Dense Prediction. (arXiv:2107.10224v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  This paper presents a simple MLP-like architecture, CycleMLP, which is a versatile backbone for visual recognition and dense predictions. As compared to modern MLP architectures, e.g., MLP-Mixer, ResMLP, and gMLP, whose architectures are correlated to image size and thus are infeasible in object detection and segmentation, CycleMLP has two advantages compared to modern approaches. (1) It can cope with various image sizes. (2) It achieves linear computational complexity to image size by using local windows. In contrast, previous MLPs have $O(N^2)$ computations due to fully spatial connections. We build a family of models which surpass existing MLPs and even state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, e.g., **Swin** Transformer, while using fewer parameters and FLOPs. We expand the MLP-like models' applicability, making them a versatile backbone for dense prediction tasks. CycleMLP achieves competitive results on object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. In particular, CycleMLP-Tiny outperforms **Swin**-Tiny by 1.3% mIoU on ADE20K dataset with fewer FLOPs. Moreover, CycleMLP also shows excellent zero-shot robustness on ImageNet-C dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/ShoufaChen/CycleMLP.

### Mathematical foundation of sparsity-based multi-illumination super-resolution. (arXiv:2202.11189v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors : Ping Liu, Sanghyeon Yu, Ola Sabet, Lucas Pelkmans, Habib Ammari

> ABSTRACT  :  It is well-known that the resolution of a traditional optical imaging system is limited by the so-called Rayleigh limit, which is of several hundreds of nanometers. By employing fluorescence techniques, modern microscopic methods can resolve point scatterers separated much lower than the Rayleigh limit. Localization-based fluorescence subwavelength imaging techniques such as PALM and STORM can achieve a spatial resolution of several tens of nanometers. However, these techniques have limited temporal resolution as they require tens of thousands of **exposure**s. Employing sparsity-based models and recovery algorithms is a natural way to reduce the number of **exposure**s and hence obtain high temporal resolution. Recently, a new multi-illumination imaging technique called Brownian Excitation Amplitude Modulation microscopy (BEAM) is introduced. BEAM achieves a threefold resolution improvement by applying a compressive sensing recovery algorithm over only few frames. Motivated by BEAM, our aim in this paper is to pioneer the mathematical foundation for sparsity-based multi-illumination super-resolution. We consider several diffraction-limited images from samples exposed to different illumination patterns and recover the source by considering the sparsest solution. We estimate the minimum separation distance between point scatterers so that they could be stably recovered. By this estimation, we reveal the dependence of the resolution on the cut-off frequency of the imaging system, the SNR, the sparsity of point scatterers, and the incoherence of illumination patterns. Our theory particularly highlights the importance of the high incoherence of illumination patterns in enhancing the resolution. It also demonstrates that super-resolution can be achieved using sparsity-based multi-illumination imaging with very few frames, whereby the spatio-temporal super-resolution becomes possible.

### **Real-time** Over-the-air Adversarial Perturbations for Digital Communications using Deep Neural Networks. (arXiv:2202.11197v1 [cs.CR])
- Authors : Cloud Cho, Sean Holloway
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11197](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11197)
> ABSTRACT  :  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in a variety of traditional radiofrequency (RF) problems. Previous work has shown that while DNN classifiers are typically more accurate than traditional signal processing algorithms, they are vulnerable to intentionally crafted adversarial perturbations which can deceive the DNN classifiers and significantly reduce their accuracy. Such intentional adversarial perturbations can be used by RF communications systems to avoid reactive-jammers and interception systems which rely on DNN classifiers to identify their target modulation scheme. While previous research on RF adversarial perturbations has established the theoretical feasibility of such attacks using simulation studies, critical questions concerning real-world implementation and viability remain unanswered. This work attempts to bridge this gap by defining class-specific and sample-independent adversarial perturbations which are shown to be effective yet computationally feasible in real-time and time-invariant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks over-the-air across a physical channel using software-defined radios (SDRs). Finally, we demonstrate that these adversarial perturbations can be emitted from a source other than the communications device, making these attacks practical for devices that cannot manipulate their transmitted signals at the physical layer.

> ABSTRACT  :  In this work, we demonstrate a novel system, namely Web of Scholars, which integrates state-of-the-art mining techniques to search, mine, and visualize complex networks behind scholars in the field of Computer Science. Relying on the knowledge graph, it provides services for fast, accurate, and intelligent semantic querying as well as powerful recommendations. In addition, in order to realize information sharing, it provides an open API to be served as the underlying architecture for advanced functions. Web of Scholars takes advantage of knowledge graph, which means that it will be able to access more knowledge if more search exist. It can be served as a useful and interoperable tool for scholars to conduct in-depth analysis within Science of Science.  
### Deep Graph Learning for Anomalous Citation Detection. (arXiv:2202.11360v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  Anomaly detection is one of the most active research areas in various critical domains, such as healthcare, fintech, and public security. However, little attention has been paid to scholarly data, i.e., anomaly detection in a citation network. Citation is considered as one of the most crucial metrics to evaluate the impact of scientific research, which may be gamed in multiple ways. Therefore, anomaly detection in citation networks is of significant importance to identify manipulation and inflation of citations. To address this open issue, we propose a novel deep graph learning model, namely GLAD (Graph Learning for Anomaly Detection), to identify anomalies in citation networks. GLAD incorporates text semantic mining to network representation learning by adding both node attributes and link attributes via graph neural networks. It exploits not only the relevance of citation contents but also hidden relationships between papers. Within the GLAD framework, we propose an algorithm called CPU (Citation PUrpose) to discover the purpose of citation based on citation texts. The performance of GLAD is validated through a simulated anomalous citation dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GLAD on the anomalous citation detection task.  
### Back2Future: Leveraging Backfill Dynamics for Improving **Real-time** Predictions in Future. (arXiv:2106.04420v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04420](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04420)
> ABSTRACT  :  In real-time forecasting in public health, data collection is a non-trivial and demanding task. Often after initially released, it undergoes several revisions later (maybe due to human or technical constraints) - as a result, it may take weeks until the data reaches to a stable value. This so-called 'backfill' phenomenon and its effect on model performance has been barely studied in the prior literature. In this paper, we introduce the multi-variate backfill problem using COVID-19 as the motivating example. We construct a detailed dataset composed of relevant signals over the past year of the pandemic. We then systematically characterize several patterns in backfill dynamics and leverage our observations for formulating a novel problem and neural framework Back2Future that aims to refines a given model's predictions in real-time. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method refines the performance of top models for COVID-19 forecasting, in contrast to non-trivial baselines, yielding 18% improvement over baselines, enabling us obtain a new SOTA performance. In addition, we show that our model improves model evaluation too; hence policy-makers can better understand the true accuracy of forecasting models in real-time.
