> ABSTRACT  :  Multispectral stereoscopy is an emerging field. A lot of work has been done in classical stereoscopy, but multispectral stereoscopy is not studied as frequently. This type of stereoscopy can be used in autonomous vehicles to complete the information given by RGB cameras. It helps to identify objects in the surroundings when the conditions are more difficult, such as in **night** scenes. This paper focuses on the RGB-LWIR spectrum. RGB-LWIR stereoscopy has the same challenges as classical stereoscopy, that is occlusions, textureless surfaces and repetitive patterns, plus specific ones related to the different modalities. Finding matches between two spectrums adds another layer of complexity. Color, texture and shapes are more likely to vary from a spectrum to another. To address this additional challenge, this paper focuses on estimating the disparity of people present in a scene. Given the fact that people's shape is captured in both RGB and LWIR, we propose a novel method that uses segmentation masks of the human in both spectrum and than concatenate them to the original images before the first layer of a Siamese Network. This method helps to improve the accuracy, particularly within the one pixel error range.

> ABSTRACT  :  **HDR** is an important part of computational photography technology. In this paper, we propose a lightweight neural network called Efficient Attention-and-alignment-guided Progressive Network (EAPNet) for the challenge NTIRE 2022 **HDR** Track 1 and Track 2. We introduce a multi-dimensional lightweight encoding module to extract features. Besides, we propose Progressive Dilated U-shape Block (PDUB) that can be a progressive plug-and-play module for dynamically tuning MAccs and PSNR. Finally, we use fast and low-power feature-align module to deal with misalignment problem in place of the time-consuming Deformable Convolutional Network (DCN). The experiments show that our method achieves about 20 times compression on MAccs with better mu-PSNR and PSNR compared to the state-of-the-art method. We got the second place of both two tracks during the testing phase. Figure1. shows the visualized result of NTIRE 2022 **HDR** challenge.  
### **Dark** Spot Detection from SAR Images Based on Superpixel Deeper Graph Convolutional Network. (arXiv:2204.09230v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the main instrument utilized for the detection of oil slicks on the ocean surface. In SAR images, some areas affected by ocean phenomena, such as rain cells, upwellings, and internal waves, or discharge from oil spills appear as **dark** spots on images. **Dark** spot detection is the first step in the detection of oil spills, which then become oil slick candidates. The accuracy of **dark** spot segmentation ultimately affects the accuracy of oil slick identification. Although some advanced deep learning methods that use pixels as processing units perform well in remote sensing image semantic segmentation, detecting some **dark** spots with weak boundaries from noisy SAR images remains a huge challenge. We propose a **dark** spot detection method based on superpixels deeper graph convolutional networks (SGDCN) in this paper, which takes the superpixels as the processing units and extracts features for each superpixel. The features calculated from superpixel regions are more robust than those from fixed pixel neighborhoods. To reduce the difficulty of learning tasks, we discard irrelevant features and obtain an optimal subset of features. After superpixel segmentation, the images are transformed into graphs with superpixels as nodes, which are fed into the deeper graph convolutional neural network for node classification. This graph neural network uses a differentiable aggregation function to aggregate the features of nodes and neighbors to form more advanced features. It is the first time using it for **dark** spot detection. To validate our method, we mark all **dark** spots on six SAR images covering the Baltic Sea and construct a **dark** spots detection dataset, which has been made publicly available (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12UavrntkDSPrItISQ8iGefXn2gIZHxJ6?usp=sharing). The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SGDCN is robust and effective.  
### A 3-stage Spectral-spatial Method for Hyperspectral Image Classification. (arXiv:2204.09294v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Ruoning Li
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09294](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09294)
> ABSTRACT  :  Hyperspectral images often have hundreds of spectral bands of different wavelengths captured by aircraft or satellites that record land coverage. Identifying detailed classes of pixels becomes feasible due to the **enhancement** in spectral and spatial resolution of hyperspectral images. In this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes both spatial and spectral information for classifying pixels in hyperspectral images. The method consists of three stages. In the first stage, the pre-processing stage, Nested Sliding Window algorithm is used to reconstruct the original data by {enhancing the consistency of neighboring pixels} and then Principal Component Analysis is used to reduce the dimension of data. In the second stage, Support Vector Machines are trained to estimate the pixel-wise probability map of each class using the spectral information from the images. Finally, a smoothed total variation model is applied to smooth the class probability vectors by {ensuring spatial connectivity} in the images. We demonstrate the superiority of our method against three state-of-the-art algorithms on six benchmark hyperspectral data sets with 10 to 50 training labels for each class. The results show that our method gives the overall best performance in accuracy. Especially, our gain in accuracy increases when the number of labeled pixels decreases and therefore our method is more advantageous to be applied to problems with small training set. Hence it is of great practical significance since expert annotations are often expensive and difficult to collect.

> ABSTRACT  :  This paper proposes a new technique based on a non-linear Minmax Detector Based (MDB) filter for image **restoration**. The aim of image **enhancement** is to reconstruct the true image from the corrupted image. The process of image acquisition frequently leads to degradation and the quality of the digitized image becomes inferior to the original image. Image degradation can be due to the addition of different types of noise in the original image. Image noise can be modelled of many types and impulse noise is one of them. Impulse noise generates pixels with gray value not consistent with their local neighbourhood. It appears as a sprinkle of both light and **dark** or only light spots in the image. Filtering is a technique for enhancing the image. Linear filter is the filtering in which the value of an output pixel is a linear combination of neighborhood values, which can produce blur in the image. Thus a variety of smoothing techniques have been developed that are non linear. Median filter is the one of the most popular non-linear filter. When considering a small neighborhood it is highly efficient but for large window and in case of high noise it gives rise to more blurring to image. The Centre Weighted Mean (CWM) filter has got a better average performance over the median filter. However the original pixel corrupted and noise reduction is substantial under high noise condition. Hence this technique has also blurring affect on the image. To illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach, the proposed new scheme has been simulated along with the standard ones and various restored performance measures have been compared.  
### Adaptive Non-linear Filtering Technique for Image **Restoration**. (arXiv:2204.09302v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Removing noise from the any processed images is very important. Noise should be removed in such a way that important information of image should be preserved. A decisionbased nonlinear algorithm for elimination of band lines, drop lines, mark, band lost and impulses in images is presented in this paper. The algorithm performs two simultaneous operations, namely, detection of corrupted pixels and evaluation of new pixels for replacing the corrupted pixels. Removal of these artifacts is achieved without damaging edges and details. However, the restricted window size renders median operation less effective whenever noise is excessive in that case the proposed algorithm automatically switches to mean filtering. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed in terms of Mean Square Error [MSE], Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio [PSNR], Signal-to-Noise Ratio Improved [SNRI], Percentage Of Noise Attenuated [PONA], and Percentage Of Spoiled Pixels [POSP]. This is compared with standard algorithms already in use and improved performance of the proposed algorithm is presented. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is that a single algorithm can replace several independent algorithms which are required for removal of different artifacts.

### HRPose: Real-Time High-Resolution 6D Pose Estimation Network Using Knowledge Distillation. (arXiv:2204.09429v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  **Real-time** 6D object pose estimation is essential for many real-world applications, such as robotic grasping and augmented reality. To achieve an accurate object pose estimation from RGB images in real-time, we propose an effective and lightweight model, namely High-Resolution 6D Pose Estimation Network (HRPose). We adopt the efficient and small HRNetV2-W18 as a feature extractor to reduce computational burdens while generating accurate 6D poses. With only 33\% of the model size and lower computational costs, our HRPose achieves comparable performance compared with state-of-the-art models. Moreover, by transferring knowledge from a large model to our proposed HRPose through output and feature-similarity distillations, the performance of our HRPose is improved in effectiveness and efficiency. Numerical experiments on the widely-used benchmark LINEMOD demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HRPose against state-of-the-art methods.  
### GazeOnce: Real-Time Multi-Person Gaze Estimation. (arXiv:2204.09480v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Appearance-based gaze estimation aims to predict the 3D eye gaze direction from a single image. While recent deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated excellent performance, they usually assume one calibrated face in each input image and cannot output multi-person gaze in **real time**. However, simultaneous gaze estimation for multiple people in the wild is necessary for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose the first one-stage end-to-end gaze estimation method, GazeOnce, which is capable of simultaneously predicting gaze directions for multiple faces (&gt;10) in an image. In addition, we design a sophisticated data generation pipeline and propose a new dataset, MPSGaze, which contains full images of multiple people with 3D gaze ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only offers a faster speed, but also provides a lower gaze estimation error compared with state-of-the-art methods. This technique can be useful in real-time applications with multiple users.

> ABSTRACT  :  Mixture of Experts (MoE) is able to scale up vision transformers effectively. However, it requires prohibiting computation resources to train a large MoE transformer. In this paper, we propose Residual Mixture of Experts (RMoE), an efficient training pipeline for MoE vision transformers on downstream tasks, such as segmentation and detection. RMoE achieves comparable results with the upper-bound MoE training, while only introducing minor additional training cost than the lower-bound non-MoE training pipelines. The efficiency is supported by our key observation: the weights of an MoE transformer can be factored into an input-independent core and an input-dependent residual. Compared with the weight core, the weight residual can be efficiently trained with much less computation resource, e.g., finetuning on the downstream data. We show that, compared with the current MoE training pipeline, we get comparable results while saving over 30% training cost. When compared with state-of-the-art non- MoE transformers, such as **Swin**-T / CvT-13 / **Swin**-L, we get +1.1 / 0.9 / 1.0 mIoU gain on ADE20K segmentation and +1.4 / 1.6 / 0.6 AP gain on MS-COCO object detection task with less than 3% additional training cost.  
### Mutual Consistency Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation. (arXiv:2109.09960v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09960](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09960)
> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we propose a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to effectively exploit the unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep models trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain and easily mis-classified predictions in ambiguous regions (e.g., adhesive edges or thin branches) for medical image segmentation. Leveraging these region-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation model training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists of two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple slightly different decoders (i.e., using different up-sampling strategies). The statistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the model's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, we apply a novel mutual consistency constraint between one decoder's probability output and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the discrepancy of multiple outputs (i.e., the model uncertainty) during training and force the model to generate invariant results in such challenging regions, aiming at capturing more useful features. We compared the segmentation results of our MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on three public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two common semi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other existing methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

> ABSTRACT  :  Speech **enhancement** is an essential task of improving speech quality in noise scenario. Several state-of-the-art approaches have introduced visual information for speech **enhancement**,since the visual aspect of speech is essentially unaffected by acoustic environment. This paper proposes a novel frameworkthat involves visual information for speech **enhancement**, by in-corporating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). In par-ticular, the proposed visual speech **enhancement** GAN consistof two networks trained in adversarial manner, i) a generator that adopts multi-layer feature fusion convolution network to enhance input noisy speech, and ii) a discriminator that attemptsto minimize the discrepancy between the distributions of the clean speech signal and enhanced speech signal. Experiment re-sults demonstrated superior performance of the proposed modelagainst several state-of-the-art

### Estimating city-wide hourly bicycle flow using a hybrid LSTM MDN. (arXiv:2204.09620v1 [stat.ML])
- Authors : Marcus Skyum, Stefan Eriksen
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09620](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09620)
> ABSTRACT  :  Cycling can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and increase public health. With this in mind, policy-makers in cities worldwide seek to improve the bicycle mode-share. However, they often struggle against the fear and the perceived riskiness of cycling. Efforts to increase the bicycle's mode-share involve many measures, one of them being the improvement of cycling safety. This requires the analysis of the factors surrounding accidents and the outcome. However, meaningful analysis of cycling safety requires accurate bicycle flow data that is generally sparse or not even available at a segment level. Therefore, safety engineers often rely on aggregated variables or calibration factors that fail to account for variations in the cycling traffic caused by external factors. This paper fills this gap by presenting a Deep Learning based approach, the Long Short-Term Memory Mixture Density Network (LSTMMDN), to estimate hourly bicycle flow in Copenhagen, conditional on weather, temporal and road conditions at the segment level. This method addresses the shortcomings in the calibration factor method and results in 66-77\% more accurate bicycle traffic estimates. To quantify the impact of more accurate bicycle traffic estimates in cycling safety analysis, we estimate bicycle crash risk models to evaluate bicycle crashes in Copenhagen. The models are identical except for the **exposure** variables being used. One model is estimated using the LSTMMDN estimates, one using the calibration-based estimates, and one using yearly mean traffic estimates. The results show that investing in more advanced methods for obtaining bicycle volume estimates can benefit the quality, mitigating efforts by improving safety analyses and other performance measures.

### Extraction of Sleep Information from Clinical Notes of Alzheimer's Disease Patients Using Natural Language Processing. (arXiv:2204.09601v1 [cs.CL])

> ABSTRACT  :  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the United States. Sleep is one of the lifestyle-related factors that has been shown critical for optimal cognitive function in old age. . However, there is a lack of research studying the association between sleep and AD incidence. A major bottleneck for conducting such research is that the traditional way to acquire sleep information is time-consuming, inefficient, non-scalable, and limited to patients' subjective experience. In this study, we developed a rule-based NLP algorithm and machine learning models to automate the extraction of sleep-related concepts, including snoring, napping, sleep problem, bad sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, **night** wakings, and sleep duration, from the clinical notes of patients diagnosed with AD. We trained and validated the proposed models on the clinical notes retrieved from the University of Pittsburgh of Medical Center (UPMC). The results show that the rule-based NLP algorithm consistently achieved the best performance for all sleep concepts.
