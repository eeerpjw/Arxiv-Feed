> ABSTRACT  :  Facial emotion recognition is a vast and complex problem space within the domain of computer vision and thus requires a universally accepted baseline method with which to evaluate proposed models. While test datasets have served this purpose in the academic sphere real world application and testing of such models lacks any real comparison. Therefore we propose a framework in which models developed for FER can be compared and contrasted against one another in a constant standardized fashion. A lightweight convolutional neural network is trained on the AffectNet dataset a large variable dataset for facial emotion recognition and a web application is developed and deployed with our proposed framework as a proof of concept. The CNN is embedded into our application and is capable of instant **real time** facial emotion recognition. When tested on the AffectNet test set this model achieves high accuracy for emotion classification of eight different emotions. Using our framework the validity of this model and others can be properly tested by evaluating a model efficacy not only based on its accuracy on a sample test dataset, but also on in the wild experiments. Additionally, our application is built with the ability to save and store any image captured or uploaded to it for emotion recognition, allowing for the curation of more quality and diverse facial emotion recognition datasets.

> ABSTRACT  :  **Real-time** estimation of actual object depth is a module that is essential to performing various autonomous system tasks such as 3D reconstruction, scene understanding and condition assessment of machinery parts. During the last decade of machine learning, extensive deployment of deep learning methods to computer vision tasks has yielded approaches that succeed in achieving realistic depth synthesis out of a simple RGB modality. While most of these models are based on paired depth data or availability of video sequences and stereo images, methods for single-view depth synthesis in a fully unsupervised setting have hardly been explored. This study presents the most recent advances in the field of generative neural networks, leveraging them to perform fully unsupervised single-shot depth synthesis. Two generators for RGB-to-depth and depth-to-RGB transfer are implemented and simultaneously optimized using the Wasserstein-1 distance and a novel perceptual reconstruction term. To ensure that the proposed method is plausible, we comprehensively evaluate the models using industrial surface depth data as well as the Texas 3D Face Recognition Database and the SURREAL dataset that records body depth. The success observed in this study suggests the great potential for unsupervised single-shot depth estimation in real-world applications.

### Adversarial Examples for Good: Adversarial Examples Guided Imbalanced Learning. (arXiv:2201.12356v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Jie Zhang, **Lei Zhang**, Gang Li, Chao Wu
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12356](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12356)
> ABSTRACT  :  Adversarial examples are inputs for machine learning models that have been designed by attackers to cause the model to make mistakes. In this paper, we demonstrate that adversarial examples can also be utilized for good to improve the performance of imbalanced learning. We provide a new perspective on how to deal with imbalanced data: adjust the biased decision boundary by training with Guiding Adversarial Examples (GAEs). Our method can effectively increase the accuracy of minority classes while sacrificing little accuracy on majority classes. We empirically show, on several benchmark datasets, our proposed method is comparable to the state-of-the-art method. To our best knowledge, we are the first to deal with imbalanced learning with adversarial examples.  
### Planning and Learning with Adaptive Lookahead. (arXiv:2201.12403v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  The classical Policy Iteration (PI) algorithm alternates between greedy one-step policy improvement and policy evaluation. Recent literature shows that multi-step lookahead policy improvement leads to a better convergence rate at the expense of increased complexity per iteration. However, prior to running the algorithm, one cannot tell what is the best fixed lookahead horizon. Moreover, per a given run, using a lookahead of horizon larger than one is often wasteful. In this work, we propose for the first time to dynamically adapt the multi-step lookahead horizon as a function of the state and of the value estimate. We devise two PI variants and analyze the trade-off between iteration count and computational complexity per iteration. The first variant takes the desired contraction factor as the objective and minimizes the per-iteration complexity. The second variant takes as input the computational complexity per iteration and minimizes the overall contraction factor. We then devise a corresponding DQN-based algorithm with an adaptive tree search horizon. We also include a novel **enhancement** for on-policy learning: per-depth value function estimator. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of our adaptive lookahead method in a maze environment and in Atari.  
### Towards Fast and Accurate Federated Learning with non-IID Data for Cloud-Based IoT Applications. (arXiv:2201.12515v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  As a promising method of central model training on decentralized device data while securing user privacy, Federated Learning (FL)is becoming popular in Internet of Things (IoT) design. However, when the data collected by IoT devices are highly skewed in a non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) manner, the accuracy of vanilla FL method cannot be guaranteed. Although there exist various solutions that try to address the bottleneck of FL with non-IID data, most of them suffer from extra intolerable communication overhead and low model accuracy. To enable fast and accurate FL, this paper proposes a novel data-based device grouping approach that can effectively reduce the disadvantages of weight divergence during the training of non-IID data. However, since our grouping method is based on the similarity of extracted feature maps from IoT devices, it may incur additional risks of privacy **exposure**. To solve this problem, we propose an improved version by exploiting similarity information using the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithm without exposing extracted feature maps. Comprehensive experimental results on well-known benchmarks show that our approach can not only accelerate the convergence rate, but also improve the prediction accuracy for FL with non-IID data.  
### Continual self-training with bootstrapped remixing for speech **enhancement**. (arXiv:2110.10103v2 [cs.SD] UPDATED)
- Authors : Efthymios Tzinis, Yossi Adi, Buye Xu, Anurag Kumar
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10103](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10103)
> ABSTRACT  :  We propose RemixIT, a simple and novel self-supervised training method for speech **enhancement**. The proposed method is based on a continuously self-training scheme that overcomes limitations from previous studies including assumptions for the in-domain noise distribution and having access to clean target signals. Specifically, a separation teacher model is pre-trained on an out-of-domain dataset and is used to infer estimated target signals for a batch of in-domain mixtures. Next, we bootstrap the mixing process by generating artificial mixtures using permuted estimated clean and noise signals. Finally, the student model is trained using the permuted estimated sources as targets while we periodically update teacher's weights using the latest student model. Our experiments show that RemixIT outperforms several previous state-of-the-art self-supervised methods under multiple speech **enhancement** tasks. Additionally, RemixIT provides a seamless alternative for semi-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation for speech **enhancement** tasks, while being general enough to be applied to any separation task and paired with any separation model.  
### Realistic galaxy image simulation via score-based generative models. (arXiv:2111.01713v2 [astro-ph.IM] UPDATED)
- Authors : Nikhil Arora, Connor Stone, phane Courteau

> ABSTRACT  :  We show that a Denoising Diffusion Probabalistic Model (DDPM), a class of score-based generative model, can be used to produce realistic mock images that mimic observations of galaxies. Our method is tested with **Dark** Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) grz imaging of galaxies from the Photometry and Rotation curve OBservations from Extragalactic Surveys (PROBES) sample and galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Subjectively, the generated galaxies are highly realistic when compared with samples from the real dataset. We quantify the similarity by borrowing from the deep generative learning literature, using the `Fr\'echet Inception Distance' to test for subjective and morphological similarity. We also introduce the `Synthetic Galaxy Distance' metric to compare the emergent physical properties (such as total magnitude, colour and half light radius) of a ground truth parent and synthesised child dataset. We argue that the DDPM approach produces sharper and more realistic images than other generative methods such as Adversarial Networks (with the downside of more costly inference), and could be used to produce large samples of synthetic observations tailored to a specific imaging survey. We demonstrate two potential uses of the DDPM: (1) accurate in-painting of occluded data, such as satellite trails, and (2) domain transfer, where new input images can be processed to mimic the properties of the DDPM training set. Here we `DESI-fy' cartoon images as a proof of concept for domain transfer. Finally, we suggest potential applications for score-based approaches that could motivate further research on this topic within the astronomical community.
