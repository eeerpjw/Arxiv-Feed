### Quality Assessment of Low Light Restored Images: A Subjective Study and an Unsupervised Model. (arXiv:2202.02277v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors : Vignesh Kannan, Sameer Malik, Rajiv Soundararajan
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02277](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02277)
> ABSTRACT  :  The quality assessment (QA) of restored **low light** images is an important tool for benchmarking and improving **low light** **restoration** (LLR) algorithms. While several LLR algorithms exist, the subjective perception of the restored images has been much less studied. Challenges in capturing aligned **low light** and well-lit image pairs and collecting a large number of human opinion scores of quality for training, warrant the design of unsupervised (or opinion unaware) no-reference (NR) QA methods. This work studies the subjective perception of **low light** restored images and their unsupervised NR QA. Our contributions are two-fold. We first create a dataset of restored **low light** images using various LLR methods, conduct a subjective QA study and benchmark the performance of existing QA methods. We then present a self-supervised contrastive learning technique to extract distortion aware features from the restored **low light** images. We show that these features can be effectively used to build an opinion unaware image quality analyzer. Detailed experiments reveal that our unsupervised NR QA model achieves state-of-the-art performance among all such quality measures for **low light** restored images.

### Simple yet Sharp Sensitivity Analysis for Unmeasured Confounding. (arXiv:2104.13020v5 [stat.ME] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  We present a method for assessing the sensitivity of the true causal effect to unmeasured confounding. The method requires the analyst to set two intuitive parameters. Otherwise, the method is assumption-free. The method returns an interval that contains the true causal effect, and whose bounds are arbitrarily sharp, i.e. practically attainable. We show experimentally that our bounds can be tighter than those obtained by the method of Ding and VanderWeele (2016a) which, moreover, requires to set one more parameter than our method. Finally, we extend our method to bound the natural direct and indirect effects when there are measured mediators and unmeasured **exposure**-outcome confounding.  
### Self-adaptive deep neural network: Numerical approximation to functions and PDEs. (arXiv:2109.02839v2 [math.NA] UPDATED)
- Authors : Zhiqiang Cai, Jingshuang Chen, Min Liu

> ABSTRACT  :  Designing an optimal deep neural network for a given task is important and challenging in many machine learning applications. To address this issue, we introduce a self-adaptive algorithm: the adaptive network **enhancement** (ANE) method, written as loops of the form train, estimate and enhance. Starting with a small two-layer neural network (NN), the step train is to solve the optimization problem at the current NN; the step estimate is to compute a posteriori estimator/indicators using the solution at the current NN; the step enhance is to add new neurons to the current NN.    Novel network **enhancement** strategies based on the computed estimator/indicators are developed in this paper to determine how many new neurons and when a new layer should be added to the current NN. The ANE method provides a natural process for obtaining a good initialization in training the current NN; in addition, we introduce an advanced procedure on how to initialize newly added neurons for a better approximation. We demonstrate that the ANE method can automatically design a nearly minimal NN for learning functions exhibiting sharp transitional layers as well as discontinuous solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations.

### ADVERT: An Adaptive and Data-Driven Attention **Enhancement** Mechanism for Phishing Prevention. (arXiv:2106.06907v2 [cs.HC] UPDATED)
- Authors : Linan Huang, Shumeng Jia, Emily Balcetis, Quanyan Zhu

> ABSTRACT  :  Attacks exploiting the innate and the acquired vulnerabilities of human users have posed severe threats to cybersecurity. This work proposes ADVERT, a human-technical solution that generates adaptive visual aids in real-time to prevent users from inadvertence and reduce their susceptibility to phishing attacks. Based on the eye-tracking data, we extract visual states and attention states as system-level sufficient statistics to characterize the user's visual behaviors and attention status. By adopting a data-driven approach and two learning feedback of different time scales, this work has laid out a theoretical foundation to analyze, evaluate, and particularly modify the human attention process while humans make security decisions of phishing recognition. We corroborate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of ADVERT through a case study based on the data set collected from human subject experiments conducted at New York University. The results show that the visual aids can statistically increase the attention level and improve the accuracy of phishing recognition from 74.6% to a minimum of 86%. he The meta-adaptation can further improve the accuracy to 91.5% (resp. 93.7%) in less than 3 (resp. 50) tuning stages.
