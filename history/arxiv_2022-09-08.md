> ABSTRACT  :  This paper presents a novel method for restoring digital videos via a Deep Plug-and-Play (PnP) approach. Under a Bayesian formalism, the method consists in using a deep convolutional denoising network in place of the proximal operator of the prior in an alternating optimization scheme. We distinguish ourselves from prior PnP work by directly applying that method to restore a digital video from a degraded video observation. This way, a network trained once for denoising can be repurposed for other video **restoration** tasks. Our experiments in video deblurring, super-resolution, and interpolation of random missing pixels all show a clear benefit to using a network specifically designed for video denoising, as it yields better **restoration** performance and better temporal stability than a single image network with similar denoising performance using the same PnP formulation. Moreover, our method compares favorably to applying a different state-of-the-art PnP scheme separately on each frame of the sequence. This opens new perspectives in the field of video **restoration**.

> ABSTRACT  :  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to have a negative impact on healthcare systems around the world, though the vaccines have been developed and national vaccination coverage rate is steadily increasing. At the current stage, automatically segmenting the lung infection area from CT images is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Thanks to the development of deep learning technology, some deep learning solutions for lung infection segmentation have been proposed. However, due to the scattered distribution, complex background interference and blurred boundaries, the accuracy and completeness of the existing models are still unsatisfactory. To this end, we propose a boundary guided semantic learning network (BSNet) in this paper. On the one hand, the dual-branch semantic **enhancement** module that combines the top-level semantic preservation and progressive semantic integration is designed to model the complementary relationship between different high-level features, thereby promoting the generation of more complete segmentation results. On the other hand, the mirror-symmetric boundary guidance module is proposed to accurately detect the boundaries of the lesion regions in a mirror-symmetric way. Experiments on the publicly available dataset demonstrate that our BSNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art competitors and achieves a real-time inference speed of 44 FPS.

> ABSTRACT  :  For years, the YOLO series has been the de facto industry-level standard for efficient object detection. The YOLO community has prospered overwhelmingly to enrich its use in a multitude of hardware platforms and abundant scenarios. In this technical report, we strive to push its limits to the next level, stepping forward with an unwavering mindset for industry application.    Considering the diverse requirements for speed and accuracy in the real environment, we extensively examine the up-to-date object detection advancements either from industry or academia. Specifically, we heavily assimilate ideas from recent network design, training strategies, testing techniques, quantization, and optimization methods. On top of this, we integrate our thoughts and practice to build a suite of deployment-ready networks at various scales to accommodate diversified use cases. With the generous permission of YOLO authors, we name it YOLOv6. We also express our warm welcome to users and contributors for further **enhancement**. For a glimpse of performance, our YOLOv6-N hits 35.9% AP on the COCO dataset at a throughput of 1234 FPS on an NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU. YOLOv6-S strikes 43.5% AP at 495 FPS, outperforming other mainstream detectors at the same scale~(YOLOv5-S, YOLOX-S, and PPYOLOE-S). Our quantized version of YOLOv6-S even brings a new state-of-the-art 43.3% AP at 869 FPS. Furthermore, YOLOv6-M/L also achieves better accuracy performance (i.e., 49.5%/52.3%) than other detectors with a similar inference speed. We carefully conducted experiments to validate the effectiveness of each component. Our code is made available at https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6.

> ABSTRACT  :  **Real-time** object detection on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a challenging issue due to the limited computing resources of edge GPU devices as Internet of Things (IoT) nodes. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight deep learning architectures named FasterX based on YOLOX model for real-time object detection on edge GPU. First, we design an effective and lightweight PixSF head to replace the original head of YOLOX to better detect small objects, which can be further embedded in the depthwise separable convolution (DS Conv) to achieve a lighter head. Then, a slimmer structure in the Neck layer termed as SlimFPN is developed to reduce parameters of the network, which is a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we embed attention module in the Head layer to improve the feature extraction effect of the prediction head. Meanwhile, we also improve the label assignment strategy and loss function to alleviate category imbalance and box optimization problems of the UAV dataset. Finally, auxiliary heads are presented for online distillation to improve the ability of position embedding and feature extraction in PixSF head. The performance of our lightweight models are validated experimentally on the NVIDIA Jetson NX and Jetson Nano GPU embedded platforms.Extensive experiments show that FasterX models achieve better trade-off between accuracy and latency on VisDrone2021 dataset compared to state-of-the-art models.  
### AI Illustrator: Translating Raw Descriptions into Images by Prompt-based Cross-Modal Generation. (arXiv:2209.03160v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  AI illustrator aims to automatically design visually appealing images for books to provoke rich thoughts and emotions. To achieve this goal, we propose a framework for translating raw descriptions with complex semantics into semantically corresponding images. The main challenge lies in the complexity of the semantics of raw descriptions, which may be hard to be visualized (\textit{e}.\textit{g}., "gloomy" or "Asian"). It usually poses challenges for existing methods to handle such descriptions. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{P}rompt-based \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal Generation \textbf{Frame}work (PCM-Frame) to leverage two powerful pre-trained models, including CLIP and StyleGAN. Our framework consists of two components: a projection module from \textit{Text Embedding}s to \textit{Image Embedding}s based on prompts, and an adapted image generation module built on StyleGAN which takes \textit{Image Embedding}s as inputs and is trained by combined semantic consistency losses. To bridge the gap between realistic images and illustration designs, we further adopt a stylization model as post-processing in our framework for better visual effects. Benefiting from the pre-trained models, our method can handle complex descriptions and does not require external paired data for training. Furthermore, we have built a benchmark that consists of 200 raw descriptions. We conduct a user study to demonstrate our superiority over the competing methods with complicated texts. We release our code at https://github.com/researchmm/AI\_Illustrator}{https://github.com/researchmm/AI\_Illustrator

> ABSTRACT  :  Distinguishing between computer-generated (CG) and natural photographic (PG) images is of great importance to verify the authenticity and originality of digital images. However, the recent cutting-edge generation methods enable high qualities of synthesis in CG images, which makes this challenging task even trickier. To address this issue, a joint learning strategy with deep texture and high-frequency features for CG image detection is proposed. We first formulate and deeply analyze the different acquisition processes of CG and PG images. Based on the finding that multiple different modules in image acquisition will lead to different sensitivity inconsistencies to the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based rendering in images, we propose a deep texture rendering module for texture difference **enhancement** and discriminative texture representation. Specifically, the semantic segmentation map is generated to guide the affine transformation operation, which is used to recover the texture in different regions of the input image. Then, the combination of the original image and the high-frequency components of the original and rendered images are fed into a multi-branch neural network equipped with attention mechanisms, which refines intermediate features and facilitates trace exploration in spatial and channel dimensions respectively. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and a newly constructed dataset with more realistic and diverse images show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in the field by a clear margin. Besides, results also demonstrate the detection robustness and generalization ability of the proposed approach to postprocessing operations and generative adversarial network (GAN) generated images.  
### An Empirical Study on Activity Recognition in Long Surgical Videos. (arXiv:2205.02805v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Activity recognition in surgical videos is a key research area for developing next-generation devices and workflow monitoring systems. Since surgeries are long processes with highly-variable lengths, deep learning models used for surgical videos often consist of a two-stage setup using a backbone and temporal sequence model. In this paper, we investigate many state-of-the-art backbones and temporal models to find architectures that yield the strongest performance for surgical activity recognition. We first benchmark the models performance on a large-scale activity recognition dataset containing over 800 surgery videos captured in multiple clinical operating rooms. We further evaluate the models on the two smaller public datasets, the Cholec80 and Cataract-101 datasets, containing only 80 and 101 videos respectively. We empirically found that **Swin**-Transformer+BiGRU temporal model yielded strong performance on both datasets. Finally, we investigate the adaptability of the model to new domains by fine-tuning models to a new hospital and experimenting with a recent unsupervised domain adaptation approach.

### Quantitative probing: Validating causal models using quantitative domain knowledge. (arXiv:2209.03013v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Daniel Gr
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03013](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03013)
> ABSTRACT  :  We present quantitative probing as a model-agnostic framework for validating causal models in the presence of quantitative domain knowledge. The method is constructed as an analogue of the train/test split in correlation-based machine learning and as an **enhancement** of current causal validation strategies that are consistent with the logic of scientific discovery. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated using Pearl's sprinkler example, before a thorough simulation-based investigation is conducted. Limits of the technique are identified by studying exemplary failing scenarios, which are furthermore used to propose a list of topics for future research and improvements of the presented version of quantitative probing. The code for integrating quantitative probing into causal analysis, as well as the code for the presented simulation-based studies of the effectiveness of quantitative probing is provided in two separate open-source Python packages.

> ABSTRACT  :  COVID-19 impacted every part of the world, although the misinformation about the outbreak traveled faster than the virus. Misinformation spread through online social networks (OSN) often misled people from following correct medical practices. In particular, OSN bots have been a primary source of disseminating false information and initiating cyber propaganda. Existing work neglects the presence of bots that act as a catalyst in the spread and focuses on fake news detection in 'articles shared in posts' rather than the post (textual) content. Most work on misinformation detection uses manually labeled datasets that are hard to scale for building their predictive models. In this research, we overcome this challenge of data scarcity by proposing an automated approach for labeling data using verified fact-checked statements on a Twitter dataset. In addition, we combine textual features with user-level features (such as followers count and friends count) and tweet-level features (such as number of mentions, hashtags and urls in a tweet) to act as additional indicators to detect misinformation. Moreover, we analyzed the presence of bots in tweets and show that bots change their behavior over time and are most active during the misinformation campaign. We collected 10.22 Million COVID-19 related tweets and used our annotation model to build an extensive and original ground truth dataset for classification purposes. We utilize various machine learning models to accurately detect misinformation and our best classification model achieves precision (82%), recall (96%), and false positive rate (3.58%). Also, our bot analysis indicates that bots generated approximately 10% of misinformation tweets. Our methodology results in substantial **exposure** of false information, thus improving the trustworthiness of information disseminated through social media platforms.  
### Multimodal Speech **Enhancement** Using Burst Propagation. (arXiv:2209.03275v1 [cs.SD])
- Authors : Ahmed Khubaib, Mohsin Raza, Ahsan Adeel
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03275](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03275)
> ABSTRACT  :  This paper proposes the MBURST, a novel multimodal solution for audio-visual speech **enhancement**s that consider the most recent neurological discoveries regarding pyramidal cells of the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions. The so-called burst propagation implements several criteria to address the credit assignment problem in a more biologically plausible manner: steering the sign and magnitude of plasticity through feedback, multiplexing the feedback and feedforward information across layers through different weight connections, approximating feedback and feedforward connections, and linearizing the feedback signals. MBURST benefits from such capabilities to learn correlations between the noisy signal and the visual stimuli, thus attributing meaning to the speech by amplifying relevant information and suppressing noise. Experiments conducted over a Grid Corpus and CHiME3-based dataset show that MBURST can reproduce similar mask reconstructions to the multimodal backpropagation-based baseline while demonstrating outstanding energy efficiency management, reducing the neuron firing rates to values up to \textbf{$70\%$} lower. Such a feature implies more sustainable implementations, suitable and desirable for hearing aids or any other similar embedded systems.  
### A Machine Learning Analysis of Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Alcohol Consumption Habit Changes Among Healthcare Workers in the U.S. (arXiv:2112.06261v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we discuss the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on alcohol consumption habit changes among healthcare workers in the United States. We utilize multiple supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and models such as Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer perceptron, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Chi-Squared Test and mutual information method on a mental health survey data obtained from the University of Michigan Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research to find out relationships between COVID-19 related negative effects and alcohol consumption habit changes among healthcare workers. Our findings suggest that COVID-19-related school closures, COVID-19-related work schedule changes and COVID-related news **exposure** may lead to an increase in alcohol use among healthcare workers in the United States.  
### Diffusion Models: A Comprehensive Survey of Methods and Applications. (arXiv:2209.00796v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Diffusion models are a class of deep generative models that have shown impressive results on various tasks with dense theoretical founding. Although diffusion models have achieved impressive quality and diversity of sample synthesis than other state-of-the-art models, they still suffer from costly sampling procedure and sub-optimal likelihood estimation. Recent studies have shown great enthusiasm on improving the performance of diffusion model. In this article, we present a first comprehensive review of existing variants of the diffusion models. Specifically, we provide a first taxonomy of diffusion models and categorize them variants to three types, namely sampling-acceleration **enhancement**, likelihood-maximization **enhancement** and data-generalization **enhancement**. We also introduce in detail other five generative models (i.e., variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, normalizing flow, autoregressive models, and energy-based models), and clarify the connections between diffusion models and these generative models. Then we make a thorough investigation into the applications of diffusion models, including computer vision, natural language processing, waveform signal processing, multi-modal modeling, molecular graph generation, time series modeling, and adversarial purification. Furthermore, we propose new perspectives pertaining to the development of this generative model.
