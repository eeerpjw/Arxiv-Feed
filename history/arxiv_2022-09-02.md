> ABSTRACT  :  Remote sensor image object detection is an important technology for Earth observation, and is used in various tasks such as forest fire monitoring and ocean monitoring. Image object detection technology, despite the significant developments, is struggling to handle remote sensor images and small-scale objects, due to the limited pixels of small objects. Numerous existing studies have demonstrated that an effective way to promote small object detection is to introduce the spatial context. Meanwhile, recent researches for image classification have shown that spectral convolution operations can perceive long-term spatial dependence more efficiently in the frequency domain than spatial domain. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Frequency-aware Feature Pyramid Framework (FFPF) for remote sensing object detection, which consists of a novel Frequency-aware ResNet (F-ResNet) and a **Bilateral** Spectral-aware Feature Pyramid Network (BS-FPN). Specifically, the F-ResNet is proposed to perceive the spectral context information by plugging the frequency domain convolution into each stage of the backbone, extracting richer features of small objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce frequency-domain convolution into remote sensing object detection task. In addition, the BSFPN is designed to use a **bilateral** sampling strategy and skipping connection to better model the association of object features at different scales, towards unleashing the potential of the spectral context information from F-ResNet. Extensive experiments are conducted for object detection in the optical remote sensing image dataset (DIOR and DOTA). The experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our method. It achieves an average accuracy (mAP) without any tricks.

> ABSTRACT  :  We propose X-**NeRF**, a novel method to learn a Cross-Spectral scene representation given images captured from cameras with different light spectrum sensitivity, based on the Neural Radiance Fields formulation. X-**NeRF** optimizes camera poses across spectra during training and exploits Normalized Cross-Device Coordinates (NXDC) to render images of different modalities from arbitrary viewpoints, which are aligned and at the same resolution. Experiments on 16 forward-facing scenes, featuring color, multi-spectral and infrared images, confirm the effectiveness of X-**NeRF** at modeling Cross-Spectral scene representations.  
### HVTR: Hybrid Volumetric-Textural Rendering for Human Avatars. (arXiv:2112.10203v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  We propose a novel neural rendering pipeline, Hybrid Volumetric-Textural Rendering (HVTR), which synthesizes virtual human avatars from arbitrary poses efficiently and at high quality. First, we learn to encode articulated human motions on a dense UV manifold of the human body surface. To handle complicated motions (e.g., self-occlusions), we then leverage the encoded information on the UV manifold to construct a 3D volumetric representation based on a dynamic pose-conditioned neural radiance field. While this allows us to represent 3D geometry with changing topology, volumetric rendering is computationally heavy. Hence we employ only a rough volumetric representation using a pose-conditioned downsampled neural radiance field (PD-**NeRF**), which we can render efficiently at low resolutions. In addition, we learn 2D textural features that are fused with rendered volumetric features in image space. The key advantage of our approach is that we can then convert the fused features into a high-resolution, high-quality avatar by a fast GAN-based textural renderer. We demonstrate that hybrid rendering enables HVTR to handle complicated motions, render high-quality avatars under user-controlled poses/shapes and even loose clothing, and most importantly, be efficient at inference time. Our experimental results also demonstrate state-of-the-art quantitative results.

### Adan: Adaptive Nesterov Momentum Algorithm for Faster Optimizing Deep Models. (arXiv:2208.06677v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)
- Authors : Xingyu Xie, Pan Zhou, Huan Li, Zhouchen Lin, Shuicheng Yan
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06677](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06677)
> ABSTRACT  :  Adaptive gradient algorithms borrow the moving average idea of heavy ball acceleration to estimate accurate first- and second-order moments of gradient for accelerating convergence. However, Nesterov acceleration which converges faster than heavy ball acceleration in theory and also in many empirical cases is much less investigated under the adaptive gradient setting. In this work, we propose the ADAptive Nesterov momentum algorithm, Adan for short, to speed up the training of deep neural networks effectively. Adan first reformulates the vanilla Nesterov acceleration to develop a new Nesterov momentum estimation (NME) method, which avoids the extra computation and memory overhead of computing gradient at the extrapolation point. Then Adan adopts NME to estimate the first- and second-order moments of the gradient in adaptive gradient algorithms for convergence acceleration. Besides, we prove that Adan finds an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point within $O(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ stochastic gradient complexity on the nonconvex stochastic problems (e.g., deep learning problems), matching the best-known lower bound. Extensive experimental results show that Adan surpasses the corresponding SoTA optimizers on both vision transformers (ViTs) and CNNs, and sets new SoTAs for many popular networks, e.g., ResNet, ConvNext, ViT, **Swin**, MAE, LSTM, Transformer-XL, and BERT. More surprisingly, Adan can use half of the training cost (epochs) of SoTA optimizers to achieve higher or comparable performance on ViT and ResNet, e.t.c., and also shows great tolerance to a large range of minibatch size, e.g., from 1k to 32k. We hope Adan can contribute to the development of deep learning by reducing training cost and relieving engineering burden of trying different optimizers on various architectures. Code is released at https://github.com/sail-sg/Adan.
