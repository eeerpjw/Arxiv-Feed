> ABSTRACT  :  A new event camera dataset, EVIMO2, is introduced that improves on the popular EVIMO dataset by providing more data, from better cameras, in more complex scenarios. As with its predecessor, EVIMO2 provides labels in the form of per-pixel ground truth depth and segmentation as well as camera and object poses. All sequences use data from physical cameras and many sequences feature multiple independently moving objects. Typically, such labeled data is unavailable in physical event camera datasets. Thus, EVIMO2 will serve as a challenging benchmark for existing algorithms and rich training set for the development of new algorithms. In particular, EVIMO2 is suited for supporting research in motion and object segmentation, optical flow, structure from motion, and visual (inertial) odometry in both monocular or stereo configurations.    EVIMO2 consists of 41 minutes of data from three 640$\times$480 event cameras, one 2080$\times$1552 classical color camera, inertial measurements from two six axis inertial measurement units, and millimeter accurate object poses from a Vicon motion capture system. The dataset's 173 sequences are arranged into three categories. 3.75 minutes of independently moving household objects, 22.55 minutes of static scenes, and 14.85 minutes of basic motions in shallow scenes. Some sequences were recorded in **low-light** conditions where conventional cameras fail. Depth and segmentation are provided at 60 Hz for the event cameras and 30 Hz for the classical camera. The masks can be regenerated using open-source code up to rates as high as 200 Hz.    This technical report briefly describes EVIMO2. The full documentation is available online. Videos of individual sequences can be sampled on the download page.

> ABSTRACT  :  The dense rain accumulation in heavy rain can significantly wash out images and thus destroy the background details of images. Although existing deep rain removal models lead to improved performance for heavy rain removal, we find that most of them ignore the detail reconstruction accuracy of rain-free images. In this paper, we propose a dual-stage progressive **enhancement** network (DPENet) to achieve effective deraining with structure-accurate rain-free images. Two main modules are included in our framework, namely a rain streaks removal network (R$^2$Net) and a detail reconstruction network (DRNet). The former aims to achieve accurate rain removal, and the latter is designed to recover the details of rain-free images. We introduce two main strategies within our networks to achieve trade-off between the effectiveness of deraining and the detail **restoration** of rain-free images. Firstly, a dilated dense residual block (DDRB) within the rain streaks removal network is presented to aggregate high/low level features of heavy rain. Secondly, an enhanced residual pixel-wise attention block (ERPAB) within the detail reconstruction network is designed for context information aggregation. We also propose a comprehensive loss function to highlight the marginal and regional accuracy of rain-free images. Extensive experiments on benchmark public datasets show both efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving structure-preserving rain-free images for heavy rain removal.

### Representation Learning for Compressed Video Action Recognition via Attentive Cross-modal Interaction with Motion **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2205.03569v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention, since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g., motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion **Enhancement** (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.  
### GenISP: Neural ISP for Low-Light Machine Cognition. (arXiv:2205.03688v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Object detection in **low-light** conditions remains a challenging but important problem with many practical implications. Some recent works show that, in **low-light** conditions, object detectors using raw image data are more robust than detectors using image data processed by a traditional ISP pipeline. To improve detection performance in **low-light** conditions, one can fine-tune the detector to use raw image data or use a dedicated **low-light** neural pipeline trained with paired low- and normal-light data to restore and enhance the image. However, different camera sensors have different spectral sensitivity and learning-based models using raw images process data in the sensor-specific color space. Thus, once trained, they do not guarantee generalization to other camera sensors. We propose to improve generalization to unseen camera sensors by implementing a minimal neural ISP pipeline for machine cognition, named GenISP, that explicitly incorporates Color Space Transformation to a device-independent color space. We also propose a two-stage color processing implemented by two image-to-parameter modules that take down-sized image as input and regress global color correction parameters. Moreover, we propose to train our proposed GenISP under the guidance of a pre-trained object detector and avoid making assumptions about perceptual quality of the image, but rather optimize the image representation for machine cognition. At the inference stage, GenISP can be paired with any object detector. We perform extensive experiments to compare our method to other **low-light** image **restoration** and **enhancement** methods in an extrinsic task-based evaluation and validate that GenISP can generalize to unseen sensors and object detectors. Finally, we contribute a **low-light** dataset of 7K raw images annotated with 46K bounding boxes for task-based benchmarking of future **low-light** image **restoration** and object detection.

> ABSTRACT  :  Rubbing **restoration**s are significant for preserving world cultural history. In this paper, we propose the RubbingGAN model for restoring incomplete rubbing characters. Specifically, we collect characters from the Zhang Menglong Bei and build up the first rubbing **restoration** dataset. We design the first generative adversarial network for rubbing **restoration**. Based on the dataset we collect, we apply the RubbingGAN to learn the Zhang Menglong Bei font style and restore the characters. The results of experiments show that RubbingGAN can repair both slightly and severely incomplete rubbing characters fast and effectively.  
### Semi-Cycled Generative Adversarial Networks for Real-World Face Super-Resolution. (arXiv:2205.03777v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Real-world face super-resolution (SR) is a highly ill-posed image **restoration** task. The fully-cycled Cycle-GAN architecture is widely employed to achieve promising performance on face SR, but prone to produce artifacts upon challenging cases in real-world scenarios, since joint participation in the same degradation branch will impact final performance due to huge domain gap between real-world and synthetic LR ones obtained by generators. To better exploit the powerful generative capability of GAN for real-world face SR, in this paper, we establish two independent degradation branches in the forward and backward cycle-consistent reconstruction processes, respectively, while the two processes share the same **restoration** branch. Our Semi-Cycled Generative Adversarial Networks (SCGAN) is able to alleviate the adverse effects of the domain gap between the real-world LR face images and the synthetic LR ones, and to achieve accurate and robust face SR performance by the shared **restoration** branch regularized by both the forward and backward cycle-consistent learning processes. Experiments on two synthetic and two real-world datasets demonstrate that, our SCGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on recovering the face structures/details and quantitative metrics for real-world face SR. The code will be publicly released at https://github.com/HaoHou-98/SCGAN.  
### Masked Co-attentional Transformer reconstructs 100x ultra-fast/low-dose whole-body PET from longitudinal images and anatomically guided MRI. (arXiv:2205.04044v1 [eess.IV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Despite its tremendous value for the diagnosis, treatment monitoring and surveillance of children with cancer, whole body staging with positron emission tomography (PET) is time consuming and associated with considerable radiation **exposure**. 100x (1% of the standard clinical dosage) ultra-low-dose/ultra-fast whole-body PET reconstruction has the potential for cancer imaging with unprecedented speed and improved safety, but it cannot be achieved by the naive use of machine learning techniques. In this study, we utilize the global similarity between baseline and follow-up PET and magnetic resonance (MR) images to develop Masked-LMCTrans, a longitudinal multi-modality co-attentional CNN-Transformer that provides interaction and joint reasoning between serial PET/MRs of the same patient. We mask the tumor area in the referenced baseline PET and reconstruct the follow-up PET scans. In this manner, Masked-LMCTrans reconstructs 100x almost-zero radio-**exposure** whole-body PET that was not possible before. The technique also opens a new pathway for longitudinal radiology imaging reconstruction, a significantly under-explored area to date. Our model was trained and tested with Stanford PET/MRI scans of pediatric lymphoma patients and evaluated externally on PET/MRI images from T\"ubingen University. The high image quality of the reconstructed 100x whole-body PET images resulting from the application of Masked-LMCTrans will substantially advance the development of safer imaging approaches and shorter exam-durations for pediatric patients, as well as expand the possibilities for frequent longitudinal monitoring of these patients by PET.  
### Carving out the low surface brightness universe with NoiseChisel. (arXiv:1909.11230v2 [astro-ph.IM] UPDATED)
- Authors : Mohammad Akhlaghi
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11230](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11230)
> ABSTRACT  :  NoiseChisel is a program to detect very low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) features with minimal assumptions on their morphology. It was introduced in 2015 and released within a collection of data analysis programs and libraries known as GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro). The 10th stable version of Gnuastro was released in August 2019 and NoiseChisel has significantly improved: detecting even fainter signal, enabling better user control over its inner workings, and many bug fixes. The most important change until version 0.10 is that NoiseChisel's segmentation features have been moved into a new program called Segment. Another major change is the final growth strategy of its true detections, for example NoiseChisel is able to detect the outer wings of M51 down to S/N of 0.25, or 25.97 mag/arcsec2 on a single-**exposure** SDSS image (r-band). Segment is also able to detect the localized HII regions as "clumps" much more successfully. For a detailed list of improvements after version 0.10, see the most recent manual. Finally, to orchestrate a controlled analysis, the concept of reproducibility is discussed: this paper itself is exactly reproducible (commit 751467d).

### Personalized QoE **Enhancement** for Adaptive Video Streaming: A Digital Twin-Assisted Scheme. (arXiv:2205.04014v1 [eess.IV])

> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we present a digital twin (DT)-assisted adaptive video streaming scheme to enhance personalized quality-of-experience (PQoE). Since PQoE models are user-specific and time-varying, existing schemes based on universal and time-invariant PQoE models may suffer from performance degradation. To address this issue, we first propose a DT-assisted PQoE model construction method to obtain accurate user-specific PQoE models. Specifically, user DTs (UDTs) are respectively constructed for individual users, which can acquire and utilize users' data to accurately tune PQoE model parameters in **real time**. Next, given the obtained PQoE models, we formulate a resource management problem to maximize the overall long-term PQoE by taking the dynamics of user' locations, video content requests, and buffer statuses into account. To solve this problem, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to jointly determine segment version selection, and communication and computing resource allocation. Simulation results on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively enhance PQoE compared with benchmark schemes.

### TransEM:Residual **Swin**-Transformer based regularized PET image reconstruction. (arXiv:2205.04204v1 [eess.IV])
- Authors : Rui Hu, Huafeng Liu
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04204](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04204)
> ABSTRACT  :  Positron emission tomography(PET) image reconstruction is an ill-posed inverse problem and suffers from high level of noise due to limited counts received. Recently deep neural networks especially convolutional neural networks(CNN) have been successfully applied to PET image reconstruction. However, the local characteristics of the convolution operator potentially limit the image quality obtained by current CNN-based PET image reconstruction methods. In this paper, we propose a residual swin-transformer based regularizer(RSTR) to incorporate regularization into the iterative reconstruction framework. Specifically, a convolution layer is firstly adopted to extract shallow features, then the deep feature extraction is accomplished by the swin-transformer layer. At last, both deep and shallow features are fused with a residual operation and another convolution layer. Validations on the realistic 3D brain simulated low-count data show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures.

> ABSTRACT  :  Image compression has raised widespread interest recently due to its significant importance for multimedia storage and transmission. Meanwhile, a reliable image quality assessment (IQA) for compressed images can not only help to verify the performance of various compression algorithms but also help to guide the compression optimization in turn. In this paper, we design a full-reference image quality assessment metric **Swin**IQA to measure the perceptual quality of compressed images in a learned **Swin** distance space. It is known that the compression artifacts are usually non-uniformly distributed with diverse distortion types and degrees. To warp the compressed images into the shared representation space while maintaining the complex distortion information, we extract the hierarchical feature representations from each stage of the **Swin** Transformer. Besides, we utilize cross attention operation to map the extracted feature representations into a learned **Swin** distance space. Experimental results show that the proposed metric achieves higher consistency with human's perceptual judgment compared with both traditional methods and learning-based methods on CLIC datasets.

> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, we developed innovative digital twins of cattle status that are powered by artificial intelligence (AI). The work was built on a farm IoT system that remotely monitors and tracks the state of cattle. A digital twin model of cattle health based on Deep Learning (DL) was generated using the sensor data acquired from the farm IoT system. The health and physiological cycle of cattle can be monitored in **real time**, and the state of the next physiological cycle of cattle can be anticipated using this model. The basis of this work is the vast amount of data which is required to validate the legitimacy of the digital twins model. In terms of behavioural state, it was found that the cattle treated with a combination of topical anaesthetic and meloxicam exhibits the least pain reaction. The digital twins model developed in this work can be used to monitor the health of cattle

> ABSTRACT  :  In recent years, a great variety of nature- and bio-inspired algorithms has been reported in the literature. This algorithmic family simulates different biological processes observed in Nature in order to efficiently address complex optimization problems. In the last years the number of bio-inspired optimization approaches in literature has grown considerably, reaching unprecedented levels that **dark** the future prospects of this field of research. This paper addresses this problem by proposing two comprehensive, principle-based taxonomies that allow researchers to organize existing and future algorithmic developments into well-defined categories, considering two different criteria: the source of inspiration and the behavior of each algorithm. Using these taxonomies we review more than three hundred publications dealing with nature-inspired and bio-inspired algorithms, and proposals falling within each of these categories are examined, leading to a critical summary of design trends and similarities between them, and the identification of the most similar classical algorithm for each reviewed paper. From our analysis we conclude that a poor relationship is often found between the natural inspiration of an algorithm and its behavior. Furthermore, similarities in terms of behavior between different algorithms are greater than what is claimed in their public disclosure: specifically, we show that more than one-third of the reviewed bio-inspired solvers are versions of classical algorithms. Grounded on the conclusions of our critical analysis, we give several recommendations and points of improvement for better methodological practices in this active and growing research field.  
### Using Constraint Programming and Graph Representation Learning for Generating Interpretable Cloud Security Policies. (arXiv:2205.01240v2 [cs.CR] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Modern software systems rely on mining insights from business sensitive data stored in public clouds. A data breach usually incurs significant (monetary) loss for a commercial organization. Conceptually, cloud security heavily relies on Identity Access Management (IAM) policies that IT admins need to properly configure and periodically update. Security negligence and human errors often lead to misconfiguring IAM policies which may open a backdoor for attackers. To address these challenges, first, we develop a novel framework that encodes generating optimal IAM policies using constraint programming (CP). We identify reducing **dark** permissions of cloud users as an optimality criterion, which intuitively implies minimizing unnecessary datastore access permissions. Second, to make IAM policies interpretable, we use graph representation learning applied to historical access patterns of users to augment our CP model with similarity constraints: similar users should be grouped together and share common IAM policies. Third, we describe multiple attack models and show that our optimized IAM policies significantly reduce the impact of security attacks using real data from 8 commercial organizations, and synthetic instances.
