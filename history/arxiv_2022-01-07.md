> ABSTRACT  :  The existence of real-world adversarial examples (commonly in the form of patches) poses a serious threat for the use of deep learning models in safety-critical computer vision tasks such as visual perception in autonomous driving. This paper presents an extensive evaluation of the robustness of semantic segmentation models when attacked with different types of adversarial patches, including digital, simulated, and physical ones. A novel loss function is proposed to improve the capabilities of attackers in inducing a misclassification of pixels. Also, a novel attack strategy is presented to improve the Expectation Over Transformation method for placing a patch in the scene. Finally, a state-of-the-art method for detecting adversarial patch is first extended to cope with semantic segmentation models, then improved to obtain real-time performance, and eventually evaluated in real-world scenarios. Experimental results reveal that, even though the adversarial effect is visible with both digital and real-world attacks, its impact is often spatially confined to areas of the image around the patch. This opens to further questions about the spatial robustness of real-time semantic segmentation models.

> ABSTRACT  :  Augmented reality devices have the potential to enhance human perception and enable other assistive functionalities in complex conversational environments. Effectively capturing the audio-visual context necessary for understanding these social interactions first requires detecting and localizing the voice activities of the device wearer and the surrounding people. These tasks are challenging due to their egocentric nature: the wearer's head motion may cause motion blur, surrounding people may appear in difficult viewing angles, and there may be occlusions, visual clutter, audio noise, and bad lighting. Under these conditions, previous state-of-the-art active speaker detection methods do not give satisfactory results. Instead, we tackle the problem from a new setting using both video and multi-channel microphone array audio. We propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach that is able to give robust voice activity detection and localization results. In contrast to previous methods, our method localizes active speakers from all possible directions on the sphere, even outside the camera's field of view, while simultaneously detecting the device wearer's own voice activity. Our experiments show that the proposed method gives superior results, can run in **real time**, and is robust against noise and clutter.

> ABSTRACT  :  Advances in the state of the art for 3d human sensing are currently limited by the lack of visual datasets with 3d ground truth, including multiple people, in motion, operating in real-world environments, with complex illumination or occlusion, and potentially observed by a moving camera. Sophisticated scene understanding would require estimating human pose and shape as well as gestures, towards representations that ultimately combine useful metric and behavioral signals with free-viewpoint photo-realistic visualisation capabilities. To sustain progress, we build a large-scale photo-realistic dataset, Human-SPACE (HSPACE), of animated humans placed in complex synthetic indoor and outdoor environments. We combine a hundred diverse individuals of varying ages, gender, proportions, and ethnicity, with hundreds of motions and scenes, as well as parametric variations in body shape (for a total of 1,600 different humans), in order to generate an initial dataset of over 1 million frames. Human animations are obtained by fitting an expressive human body model, GHUM, to single scans of people, followed by novel re-targeting and positioning procedures that support the realistic animation of dressed humans, statistical variation of body proportions, and jointly consistent scene placement of multiple moving people. Assets are generated automatically, at scale, and are compatible with existing **real time** rendering and game engines. The dataset with evaluation server will be made available for research. Our large-scale analysis of the impact of synthetic data, in connection with real data and weak supervision, underlines the considerable potential for continuing quality improvements and limiting the sim-to-real gap, in this practical setting, in connection with increased model capacity.  
### MoCoPnet: Exploring Local Motion and Contrast Priors for Infrared Small Target Super-Resolution. (arXiv:2201.01014v3 [eess.IV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Xinyi Ying, Yingqian Wang, Longguang Wang, Weidong Sheng, Li Liu, Zaiping Lin, Shilin Zhou
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01014](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01014)
> ABSTRACT  :  Infrared small target super-resolution (SR) aims to recover reliable and detailed high-resolution image with highcontrast targets from its low-resolution counterparts. Since the infrared small target lacks color and fine structure information, it is significant to exploit the supplementary information among sequence images to enhance the target. In this paper, we propose the first infrared small target SR method named local motion and contrast prior driven deep network (MoCoPnet) to integrate the domain knowledge of infrared small target into deep network, which can mitigate the intrinsic feature scarcity of infrared small targets. Specifically, motivated by the local motion prior in the spatio-temporal dimension, we propose a local spatiotemporal attention module to perform implicit frame alignment and incorporate the local spatio-temporal information to enhance the local features (especially for small targets). Motivated by the local contrast prior in the spatial dimension, we propose a central difference residual group to incorporate the central difference convolution into the feature extraction backbone, which can achieve center-oriented gradient-aware feature extraction to further improve the target contrast. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method can recover accurate spatial dependency and improve the target contrast. Comparative results show that MoCoPnet can outperform the state-of-the-art video SR and single image SR methods in terms of both SR performance and target **enhancement**. Based on the SR results, we further investigate the influence of SR on infrared small target detection and the experimental results demonstrate that MoCoPnet promotes the detection performance. The code is available at https://github.com/XinyiYing/MoCoPnet.

### Deep Causal Reasoning for Recommendations. (arXiv:2201.02088v1 [cs.LG])
- Authors : Yaochen Zhu, Jing Yi, Jiayi Xie, Zhenzhong Chen
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02088](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02088)
> ABSTRACT  :  Traditional recommender systems aim to estimate a user's rating to an item based on observed ratings from the population. As with all observational studies, hidden confounders, which are factors that affect both item **exposure**s and user ratings, lead to a systematic bias in the estimation. Consequently, a new trend in recommender system research is to negate the influence of confounders from a causal perspective. Observing that confounders in recommendations are usually shared among items and are therefore multi-cause confounders, we model the recommendation as a multi-cause multi-outcome (MCMO) inference problem. Specifically, to remedy confounding bias, we estimate user-specific latent variables that render the item **exposure**s independent Bernoulli trials. The generative distribution is parameterized by a DNN with factorized logistic likelihood and the intractable posteriors are estimated by variational inference. Controlling these factors as substitute confounders, under mild assumptions, can eliminate the bias incurred by multi-cause confounders. Furthermore, we show that MCMO modeling may lead to high variance due to scarce observations associated with the high-dimensional causal space. Fortunately, we theoretically demonstrate that introducing user features as pre-treatment variables can substantially improve sample efficiency and alleviate overfitting. Empirical studies on simulated and real-world datasets show that the proposed deep causal recommender shows more robustness to unobserved confounders than state-of-the-art causal recommenders. Codes and datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/deep-deconf.
