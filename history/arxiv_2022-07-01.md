> ABSTRACT  :  From the nature of **dark** matter to the rate of expansion of our Universe, observations of distant galaxies distorted through strong gravitational lensing have the potential to answer some of the major open questions in astrophysics. Modeling galaxy-galaxy strong lensing observations presents a number of challenges as the exact configuration of both the background source and foreground lens galaxy is unknown. A timely call, prompted by a number of upcoming surveys anticipating high-resolution lensing images, demands methods that can efficiently model lenses at their full complexity. In this work, we introduce a method that uses continuous neural fields to non-parametrically reconstruct the complex morphology of a source galaxy while simultaneously inferring a distribution over foreground lens galaxy configurations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through experiments on simulated data targeting high-resolution lensing images similar to those anticipated in near-future astrophysical surveys.

> ABSTRACT  :  Neural radiance fields, or **NeRF**, represent a breakthrough in the field of novel view synthesis and 3D modeling of complex scenes from multi-view image collections. Numerous recent works have been focusing on making the models more robust, by means of regularization, so as to be able to train with possibly inconsistent and/or very sparse data. In this work, we scratch the surface of how differential geometry can provide regularization tools for robustly training **NeRF**-like models, which are modified so as to represent continuous and infinitely differentiable functions. In particular, we show how these tools yield a direct mathematical formalism of previously proposed **NeRF** variants aimed at improving the performance in challenging conditions (i.e. Reg**NeRF**). Based on this, we show how the same formalism can be used to natively encourage the regularity of surfaces (by means of Gaussian and Mean Curvatures) making it possible, for example, to learn surfaces from a very limited number of views.

> ABSTRACT  :  Reconstruction of the soft tissues in robotic surgery from endoscopic stereo videos is important for many applications such as intra-operative navigation and image-guided robotic surgery automation. Previous works on this task mainly rely on SLAM-based approaches, which struggle to handle complex surgical scenes. Inspired by recent progress in neural rendering, we present a novel framework for deformable tissue reconstruction from binocular captures in robotic surgery under the single-viewpoint setting. Our framework adopts dynamic neural radiance fields to represent deformable surgical scenes in MLPs and optimize shapes and deformations in a learning-based manner. In addition to non-rigid deformations, tool occlusion and poor 3D clues from a single viewpoint are also particular challenges in soft tissue reconstruction. To overcome these difficulties, we present a series of strategies of tool mask-guided ray casting, stereo depth-cueing ray marching and stereo depth-supervised optimization. With experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos, our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art reconstruction method for handling various complex non-rigid deformations. To our best knowledge, this is the first work leveraging neural rendering for surgical scene 3D reconstruction with remarkable potential demonstrated.

### Asymmetry Disentanglement Network for Interpretable Acute Ischemic Stroke Infarct Segmentation in Non-Contrast CT Scans. (arXiv:2206.15445v1 [eess.IV])

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15445](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15445)
> ABSTRACT  :  Accurate infarct segmentation in non-contrast CT (NCCT) images is a crucial step toward computer-aided acute ischemic stroke (AIS) assessment. In clinical practice, **bilateral** symmetric comparison of brain hemispheres is usually used to locate pathological abnormalities. Recent research has explored asymmetries to assist with AIS segmentation. However, most previous symmetry-based work mixed different types of asymmetries when evaluating their contribution to AIS. In this paper, we propose a novel Asymmetry Disentanglement Network (ADN) to automatically separate pathological asymmetries and intrinsic anatomical asymmetries in NCCTs for more effective and interpretable AIS segmentation. ADN first performs asymmetry disentanglement based on input NCCTs, which produces different types of 3D asymmetry maps. Then a synthetic, intrinsic-asymmetry-compensated and pathology-asymmetry-salient NCCT volume is generated and later used as input to a segmentation network. The training of ADN incorporates domain knowledge and adopts a tissue-type aware regularization loss function to encourage clinically-meaningful pathological asymmetry extraction. Coupled with an unsupervised 3D transformation network, ADN achieves state-of-the-art AIS segmentation performance on a public NCCT dataset. In addition to the superior performance, we believe the learned clinically-interpretable asymmetry maps can also provide insights towards a better understanding of AIS assessment.

### PVT v2: Improved Baselines with Pyramid Vision Transformer. (arXiv:2106.13797v6 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Transformer recently has presented encouraging progress in computer vision. In this work, we present new baselines by improving the original Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT v1) by adding three designs, including (1) linear complexity attention layer, (2) overlapping patch embedding, and (3) convolutional feed-forward network. With these modifications, PVT v2 reduces the computational complexity of PVT v1 to linear and achieves significant improvements on fundamental vision tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation. Notably, the proposed PVT v2 achieves comparable or better performances than recent works such as **Swin** Transformer. We hope this work will facilitate state-of-the-art Transformer researches in computer vision. Code is available at https://github.com/whai362/PVT.  
### Detecting Melanoma Fairly: Skin Tone Detection and Debiasing for Skin Lesion Classification. (arXiv:2202.02832v3 [eess.IV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Amir Atapour
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02832](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02832)
> ABSTRACT  :  Convolutional Neural Networks have demonstrated human-level performance in the classification of melanoma and other skin lesions, but evident performance disparities between differing skin tones should be addressed before widespread deployment. In this work, we propose an efficient yet effective algorithm for automatically labelling the skin tone of lesion images, and use this to annotate the benchmark ISIC dataset. We subsequently use these automated labels as the target for two leading bias unlearning techniques towards mitigating skin tone bias. Our experimental results provide evidence that our skin tone detection algorithm outperforms existing solutions and that unlearning skin tone improves generalisation and can reduce the performance disparity between melanoma detection in lighter and **dark**er skin tones.  
### Ab-initio Contrast Estimation and Denoising of Cryo-EM Images. (arXiv:2202.07737v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Yunpeng Shi, Amit Singer
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07737](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07737)
> ABSTRACT  :  Background and Objective: The contrast of cryo-EM images varies from one to another, primarily due to the uneven thickness of the ice layer. This contrast variation can affect the quality of 2-D class averaging, 3-D ab-initio modeling, and 3-D heterogeneity analysis. Contrast estimation is currently performed during 3-D iterative refinement. As a result, the estimates are not available at the earlier computational stages of class averaging and ab-initio modeling. This paper aims to solve the contrast estimation problem directly from the picked particle images in the ab-initio stage, without estimating the 3-D volume, image rotations, or class averages.    Methods: The key observation underlying our analysis is that the 2-D covariance matrix of the raw images is related to the covariance of the underlying clean images, the noise variance, and the contrast variability between images. We show that the contrast variability can be derived from the 2-D covariance matrix and we apply the existing Covariance Wiener Filtering (CWF) framework to estimate it. We also demonstrate a modification of CWF to estimate the contrast of individual images.    Results: Our method improves the contrast estimation by a large margin, compared to the previous CWF method. Its estimation accuracy is often comparable to that of an oracle that knows the ground truth covariance of the clean images. The more accurate contrast estimation also improves the quality of image **restoration** as demonstrated in both synthetic and experimental datasets.    Conclusions: This paper proposes an effective method for contrast estimation directly from noisy images without using any 3-D volume information. It enables contrast correction in the earlier stage of single particle analysis, and may improve the accuracy of downstream processing.

### Pulse Shape Simulation and Discrimination using Machine-Learning Techniques. (arXiv:2206.15156v1 [physics.ins-det])
- Authors : Shubham Dutta, Sayan Ghosh, Satyaki Bhattacharya, Satyajit Saha
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15156](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15156)
> ABSTRACT  :  An essential metric for the quality of a particle-identification experiment is its statistical power to discriminate between signal and background. Pulse shape discrimination (PSD) is a basic method for this purpose in many nuclear, high-energy, and rare-event search experiments where scintillator detectors are used. Conventional techniques exploit the difference between decay-times of the pulse from signal and background events or pulse signals caused by different types of radiation quanta to achieve good discrimination. However, such techniques are efficient only when the total light-emission is sufficient to get a proper pulse profile. This is only possible when there is significant recoil energy due to the incident particle in the detector. But, rare-event search experiments like neutrino or **dark**-matter direct search experiments don't always satisfy these conditions. Hence, it becomes imperative to have a method that can deliver very efficient discrimination in these scenarios. Neural network-based machine-learning algorithms have been used for classification problems in many areas of physics, especially in high-energy experiments, and have given better results compared to conventional techniques. We present the results of our investigations of two network-based methods viz. Dense Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network, for pulse shape discrimination and compare the same with conventional methods.

> ABSTRACT  :  Transformers are neural network models that utilize multiple layers of self-attention heads. Attention is implemented in transformers as the contextual embeddings of the 'key' and 'query'. Transformers allow the re-combination of attention information from different layers and the processing of all inputs at once, which are more convenient than recurrent neural networks when dealt with a large number of data. Transformers have exhibited great performances on natural language processing tasks in recent years. Meanwhile, there have been tremendous efforts to adapt transformers into other fields of machine learning, such as **Swin** Transformer and Decision Transformer. **Swin** Transformer is a promising neural network architecture that splits image pixels into small patches and applies local self-attention operations inside the (shifted) windows of fixed sizes. Decision Transformer has successfully applied transformers to off-line reinforcement learning and showed that random-walk samples from Atari games are sufficient to let an agent learn optimized behaviors. However, it is considerably more challenging to combine online reinforcement learning with transformers. In this article, we further explore the possibility of not modifying the reinforcement learning policy, but only replacing the convolutional neural network architecture with the self-attention architecture from **Swin** Transformer. Namely, we target at changing how an agent views the world, but not how an agent plans about the world. We conduct our experiment on 49 games in Arcade Learning Environment. The results show that using **Swin** Transformer in reinforcement learning achieves significantly higher evaluation scores across the majority of games in Arcade Learning Environment. Thus, we conclude that online reinforcement learning can benefit from exploiting self-attentions with spatial token embeddings.  
### Implicit Neural Spatial Filtering for Multichannel Source Separation in the Waveform Domain. (arXiv:2206.15423v1 [cs.SD])

- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15423](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15423)
> ABSTRACT  :  We present a single-stage casual waveform-to-waveform multichannel model that can separate moving sound sources based on their broad spatial locations in a dynamic acoustic scene. We divide the scene into two spatial regions containing, respectively, the target and the interfering sound sources. The model is trained end-to-end and performs spatial processing implicitly, without any components based on traditional processing or use of hand-crafted spatial features. We evaluate the proposed model on a real-world dataset and show that the model matches the performance of an oracle beamformer followed by a state-of-the-art single-channel **enhancement** network.

> ABSTRACT  :  As a neurophysiological response to threat or adverse conditions, stress can affect cognition, emotion and behaviour with potentially detrimental effects on health in the case of sustained **exposure**. Since the affective content of speech is inherently modulated by an individual's physical and mental state, a substantial body of research has been devoted to the study of paralinguistic correlates of stress-inducing task load. Historically, voice stress analysis (VSA) has been conducted using conventional digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. Despite the development of modern methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs), accurately detecting stress in speech remains difficult due to the wide variety of stressors and considerable variability in the individual stress perception. To that end, we introduce a set of five datasets for task load detection in speech. The voice recordings were collected as either cognitive or physical stress was induced in the cohort of volunteers, with a cumulative number of more than a hundred speakers. We used the datasets to design and evaluate a novel self-supervised audio representation that leverages the effectiveness of handcrafted features (DSP-based) and the complexity of data-driven DNN representations. Notably, the proposed approach outperformed both extensive handcrafted feature sets and novel DNN-based audio representation learning approaches.

> ABSTRACT  :  The 3rd Generation Partnership Project has started the study of Release 18 in 2021. Artificial intelligence (AI)-native air interface is one of the key features of Release 18, where AI for channel state information (CSI) feedback **enhancement** is selected as the representative use case. This article provides a comprehensive overview of AI for CSI feedback **enhancement** in 5G-Advanced and 6G. The scope of the AI for CSI feedback **enhancement** in 5G-Advanced, including overhead reduction, accuracy improvement, and channel prediction, is first presented and discussed. Then, three representative frameworks of AI-enabled CSI feedback, including one-sided implicit feedback, two-sided autoencoder-based implicit feedback, and two-sided explicit feedback, are introduced and compared. Finally, the considerations in the standardization of AI for CSI feedback **enhancement**, especially focusing on evaluation, complexity, collaboration, generalization, information sharing, joint design with channel prediction, and reciprocity, have been identified and discussed. This article provides a guideline for the standardization study of the AI-based CSI feedback **enhancement**.
