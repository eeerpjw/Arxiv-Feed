> ABSTRACT  :  Loop closing is a fundamental part of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for autonomous mobile systems. In the field of visual SLAM, bag of words (BoW) has achieved great success in loop closure. The BoW features for loop searching can also be used in the subsequent 6-DoF loop correction. However, for 3D LiDAR SLAM, the state-of-the-art methods may fail to effectively recognize the loop in **real time**, and usually cannot correct the full 6-DoF loop pose. To address this limitation, we present a novel Bag of Words for real-time loop closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM, called BoW3D. The novelty of our method lies in that it not only efficiently recognize the revisited loop places, but also correct the full 6-DoF loop pose in **real time**. BoW3D builds the bag of words based on the 3D feature LinK3D, which is efficient, pose-invariant and can be used for accurate point-to-point matching. We furthermore embed our proposed method into 3D LiDAR odometry system to evaluate loop closing performance. We test our method on public dataset, and compare it against other state-of-the-art algorithms. BoW3D shows better performance in terms of F1 max and extended precision scores in most scenarios with superior real-time performance. It is noticeable that BoW3D takes an average of 50 ms to recognize and correct the loops in KITTI 00 (includes 4K+ 64-ray LiDAR scans), when executed on a notebook with an Intel Core i7 @2.2 GHz processor.  
### Efficient Multimodal Transformer with Dual-Level Feature **Restoration** for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis. (arXiv:2208.07589v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  With the proliferation of user-generated online videos, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has attracted increasing attention recently. Despite significant progress, there are still two major challenges on the way towards robust MSA: 1) inefficiency when modeling cross-modal interactions in unaligned multimodal data; and 2) vulnerability to random modality feature missing which typically occurs in realistic settings. In this paper, we propose a generic and unified framework to address them, named Efficient Multimodal Transformer with Dual-Level Feature **Restoration** (EMT-DLFR). Concretely, EMT employs utterance-level representations from each modality as the global multimodal context to interact with local unimodal features and mutually promote each other. It not only avoids the quadratic scaling cost of previous local-local cross-modal interaction methods but also leads to better performance. To improve model robustness in the incomplete modality setting, on the one hand, DLFR performs low-level feature reconstruction to implicitly encourage the model to learn semantic information from incomplete data. On the other hand, it innovatively regards complete and incomplete data as two different views of one sample and utilizes siamese representation learning to explicitly attract their high-level representations. Comprehensive experiments on three popular datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both complete and incomplete modality settings.  
### Does lossy image compression affect racial bias within face recognition?. (arXiv:2208.07613v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Yes - This study investigates the impact of commonplace lossy image compression on face recognition algorithms with regard to the racial characteristics of the subject. We adopt a recently proposed racial phenotype-based bias analysis methodology to measure the effect of varying levels of lossy compression across racial phenotype categories. Additionally, we determine the relationship between chroma-subsampling and race-related phenotypes for recognition performance. Prior work investigates the impact of lossy JPEG compression algorithm on contemporary face recognition performance. However, there is a gap in how this impact varies with different race-related inter-sectional groups and the cause of this impact. Via an extensive experimental setup, we demonstrate that common lossy image compression approaches have a more pronounced negative impact on facial recognition performance for specific racial phenotype categories such as **dark**er skin tones (by up to 34.55\%). Furthermore, removing chroma-subsampling during compression improves the false matching rate (up to 15.95\%) across all phenotype categories affected by the compression, including **dark**er skin tones, wide noses, big lips, and monolid eye categories. In addition, we outline the characteristics that may be attributable as the underlying cause of such phenomenon for lossy compression algorithms such as JPEG.  
### Towards Local Underexposed Photo **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2208.07711v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Inspired by the ability of deep generative models to generate highly realistic images, much recent work has made progress in enhancing underexposed images globally. However, the local image **enhancement** approach has not been explored, although they are requisite in the real-world scenario, e.g., fixing local under**exposure**. In this work, we define a new task setting for underexposed image **enhancement** where users are able to control which region to be enlightened with an input mask. As indicated by the mask, an image can be divided into three areas, including Masked Area A, Transition Area B, and Unmasked Area C. As a result, Area A should be enlightened to the desired lighting, and there shall be a smooth transition (Area B) from the enlightened area (Area A) to the unchanged region (Area C). To finish this task, we propose two methods: Concatenate the mask as additional channels (MConcat), Mask-based Normlization (MNorm). While MConcat simply append the mask channels to the input images, MNorm can dynamically enhance the spatial-varying pixels, guaranteeing the enhanced images are consistent with the requirement indicated by the input mask. Moreover, MConcat serves as a play-and-plug module, and can be incorporated with existing networks, which globally enhance images, to achieve the local **enhancement**. And the overall network can be trained with three kinds of loss functions in Area A, Area B, and Area C, which are unified for various model structures. We perform extensive experiments on public datasets with various parametric approaches for **low-light** **enhancement**, %the Convolutional-Neutral-Network-based model and Transformer-based model, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods.  
### Dense Nested Attention Network for Infrared Small Target Detection. (arXiv:2106.00487v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection aims at separating small targets from clutter backgrounds. With the advances of deep learning, CNN-based methods have yielded promising results in generic object detection due to their powerful modeling capability. However, existing CNN-based methods cannot be directly applied for infrared small targets since pooling layers in their networks could lead to the loss of targets in deep layers. To handle this problem, we propose a dense nested attention network (DNANet) in this paper. Specifically, we design a dense nested interactive module (DNIM) to achieve progressive interaction among high-level and low-level features. With the repeated interaction in DNIM, infrared small targets in deep layers can be maintained. Based on DNIM, we further propose a cascaded channel and spatial attention module (CSAM) to adaptively enhance multi-level features. With our DNANet, contextual information of small targets can be well incorporated and fully exploited by repeated fusion and **enhancement**. Moreover, we develop an infrared small target dataset (namely, NUDT-SIRST) and propose a set of evaluation metrics to conduct comprehensive performance evaluation. Experiments on both public and our self-developed datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better performance in terms of probability of detection (Pd), false-alarm rate (Fa), and intersection of union (IoU).

> ABSTRACT  :  We propose a deep visuo-tactile model for realtime estimation of the liquid inside a deformable container in a proprioceptive way.We fuse two sensory modalities, i.e., the raw visual inputs from the RGB camera and the tactile cues from our specific tactile sensor without any extra sensor calibrations.The robotic system is well controlled and adjusted based on the estimation model in **real time**. The main contributions and novelties of our work are listed as follows: 1) Explore a proprioceptive way for liquid volume estimation by developing an end-to-end predictive model with multi-modal convolutional networks, which achieve a high precision with an error of around 2 ml in the experimental validation. 2) Propose a multi-task learning architecture which comprehensively considers the losses from both classification and regression tasks, and comparatively evaluate the performance of each variant on the collected data and actual robotic platform. 3) Utilize the proprioceptive robotic system to accurately serve and control the requested volume of liquid, which is continuously flowing into a deformable container in **real time**. 4) Adaptively adjust the grasping plan to achieve more stable grasping and manipulation according to the real-time liquid volume prediction.

### **Enhancement** to Training of Bidirectional GAN : An Approach to Demystify Tax Fraud. (arXiv:2208.07675v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  Outlier detection is a challenging activity. Several machine learning techniques are proposed in the literature for outlier detection. In this article, we propose a new training approach for bidirectional GAN (BiGAN) to detect outliers. To validate the proposed approach, we train a BiGAN with the proposed training approach to detect taxpayers, who are manipulating their tax returns. For each taxpayer, we derive six correlation parameters and three ratio parameters from tax returns submitted by him/her. We train a BiGAN with the proposed training approach on this nine-dimensional derived ground-truth data set. Next, we generate the latent representation of this data set using the $encoder$ (encode this data set using the $encoder$) and regenerate this data set using the $generator$ (decode back using the $generator$) by giving this latent representation as the input. For each taxpayer, compute the cosine similarity between his/her ground-truth data and regenerated data. Taxpayers with lower cosine similarity measures are potential return manipulators. We applied our method to analyze the iron and steel taxpayers data set provided by the Commercial Taxes Department, Government of Telangana, India.
