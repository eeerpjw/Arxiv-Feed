> ABSTRACT  :  **Night**time thermal infrared (NTIR) image colorization, also known as translation of NTIR images into daytime color images (NTIR2DC), is a promising research direction to facilitate **night**time scene perception for humans and intelligent systems under unfavorable conditions (e.g., complete **dark**ness). However, previously developed methods have poor colorization performance for small sample classes. Moreover, reducing the high confidence noise in pseudo-labels and addressing the problem of image gradient disappearance during translation are still under-explored, and keeping edges from being distorted during translation is also challenging. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel learning framework called Memory-guided cOllaboRative atteNtion Generative Adversarial Network (MornGAN), which is inspired by the analogical reasoning mechanisms of humans. Specifically, a memory-guided sample selection strategy and adaptive collaborative attention loss are devised to enhance the semantic preservation of small sample categories. In addition, we propose an online semantic distillation module to mine and refine the pseudo-labels of NTIR images. Further, conditional gradient repair loss is introduced for reducing edge distortion during translation. Extensive experiments on the NTIR2DC task show that the proposed MornGAN significantly outperforms other image-to-image translation methods in terms of semantic preservation and edge consistency, which helps improve the object detection accuracy remarkably.

> ABSTRACT  :  Compressed video super-resolution (VSR) aims to restore high-resolution frames from compressed low-resolution counterparts. Most recent VSR approaches often enhance an input frame by borrowing relevant textures from neighboring video frames. Although some progress has been made, there are grand challenges to effectively extract and transfer high-quality textures from compressed videos where most frames are usually highly degraded. In this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Transformer for compressed video super-resolution (FTVSR) that conducts self-attention over a joint space-time-frequency domain. First, we divide a video frame into patches, and transform each patch into DCT spectral maps in which each channel represents a frequency band. Such a design enables a fine-grained level self-attention on each frequency band, so that real visual texture can be distinguished from artifacts, and further utilized for video frame **restoration**. Second, we study different self-attention schemes, and discover that a divided attention which conducts a joint space-frequency attention before applying temporal attention on each frequency band, leads to the best video **enhancement** quality. Experimental results on two widely-used video super-resolution benchmarks show that FTVSR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both uncompressed and compressed videos with clear visual margins.

### **Low-Light** Hyperspectral Image **Enhancement**. (arXiv:2208.03042v1 [eess.IV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Due to inadequate energy captured by the hyperspectral camera sensor in poor illumination conditions, **low-light** hyperspectral images (HSIs) usually suffer from low visibility, spectral distortion, and various noises. A range of HSI **restoration** methods have been developed, yet their effectiveness in enhancing **low-light** HSIs is constrained. This work focuses on the **low-light** HSI **enhancement** task, which aims to reveal the spatial-spectral information hidden in **dark**ened areas. To facilitate the development of **low-light** HSI processing, we collect a **low-light** HSI (LHSI) dataset of both indoor and outdoor scenes. Based on Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction, we developed an end-to-end data-driven **low-light** HSI **enhancement** (HSIE) approach trained on the LHSI dataset. With the observation that illumination is related to the low-frequency component of HSI, while textural details are closely correlated to the high-frequency component, the proposed HSIE is designed to have two branches. The illumination **enhancement** branch is adopted to enlighten the low-frequency component with reduced resolution. The high-frequency refinement branch is utilized for refining the high-frequency component via a predicted mask. In addition, to improve information flow and boost performance, we introduce an effective channel attention block (CAB) with residual dense connection, which served as the basic block of the illumination **enhancement** branch. The effectiveness and efficiency of HSIE both in quantitative assessment measures and visual effects are demonstrated by experimental results on the LHSI dataset. According to the classification performance on the remote sensing Indian Pines dataset, downstream tasks benefit from the enhanced HSI.

### Exploring Resolution and Degradation Clues as Self-supervised Signal for Low Quality Object Detection. (arXiv:2208.03062v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Image **restoration** algorithms such as super resolution (SR) are indispensable pre-processing modules for object detection in low quality images. Most of these algorithms assume the degradation is fixed and known a priori. However, in practical, either the real degradation or optimal up-sampling ratio rate is unknown or differs from assumption, leading to a deteriorating performance for both the pre-processing module and the consequent high-level task such as object detection. Here, we propose a novel self-supervised framework to detect objects in degraded low resolution images. We utilizes the downsampling degradation as a kind of transformation for self-supervised signals to explore the equivariant representation against various resolutions and other degradation conditions. The Auto Encoding Resolution in Self-supervision (AERIS) framework could further take the advantage of advanced SR architectures with an arbitrary resolution restoring decoder to reconstruct the original correspondence from the degraded input image. Both the representation learning and object detection are optimized jointly in an end-to-end training fashion. The generic AERIS framework could be implemented on various mainstream object detection architectures with different backbones. The extensive experiments show that our methods has achieved superior performance compared with existing methods when facing variant degradation situations. Code would be released at https://github.com/cuiziteng/ECCV_AERIS.  
### **Real-time** Gesture Animation Generation from Speech for Virtual Human Interaction. (arXiv:2208.03244v1 [cs.CV])
- Authors : Manuel Rebol, Krzysztof Pietroszek
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03244](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03244)
> ABSTRACT  :  We propose a real-time system for synthesizing gestures directly from speech. Our data-driven approach is based on Generative Adversarial Neural Networks to model the speech-gesture relationship. We utilize the large amount of speaker video data available online to train our 3D gesture model. Our model generates speaker-specific gestures by taking consecutive audio input chunks of two seconds in length. We animate the predicted gestures on a virtual avatar. We achieve a delay below three seconds between the time of audio input and gesture animation. Code and videos are available at https://github.com/mrebol/Gestures-From-Speech  
### TAPE: Task-Agnostic Prior Embedding for Image **Restoration**. (arXiv:2203.06074v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Learning a generalized prior for natural image **restoration** is an important yet challenging task. Early methods mostly involved handcrafted priors including normalized sparsity, l_0 gradients, **dark** channel priors, etc. Recently, deep neural networks have been used to learn various image priors but do not guarantee to generalize. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that embeds a task-agnostic prior into a transformer. Our approach, named Task-Agnostic Prior Embedding (TAPE), consists of two stages, namely, task-agnostic pre-training and task-specific fine-tuning, where the first stage embeds prior knowledge about natural images into the transformer and the second stage extracts the knowledge to assist downstream image **restoration**. Experiments on various types of degradation validate the effectiveness of TAPE. The image **restoration** performance in terms of PSNR is improved by as much as 1.45dB and even outperforms task-specific algorithms. More importantly, TAPE shows the ability of disentangling generalized image priors from degraded images, which enjoys favorable transfer ability to unknown downstream tasks.  
### FWD: **Real-time** Novel View Synthesis with Forward Warping and Depth. (arXiv:2206.08355v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Novel view synthesis (NVS) is a challenging task requiring systems to generate photorealistic images of scenes from new viewpoints, where both quality and speed are important for applications. Previous image-based rendering (IBR) methods are fast, but have poor quality when input views are sparse. Recent Neural Radiance Fields (**NeRF**) and generalizable variants give impressive results but are not real-time. In our paper, we propose a generalizable NVS method with sparse inputs, called FWD, which gives high-quality synthesis in real-time. With explicit depth and differentiable rendering, it achieves competitive results to the SOTA methods with 130-1000x speedup and better perceptual quality. If available, we can seamlessly integrate sensor depth during either training or inference to improve image quality while retaining real-time speed. With the growing prevalence of depths sensors, we hope that methods making use of depth will become increasingly useful.  
### BATMAN: **Bilateral** Attention Transformer in Motion-Appearance Neighboring Space for Video Object Segmentation. (arXiv:2208.01159v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is fundamental to video understanding. Transformer-based methods show significant performance improvement on semi-supervised VOS. However, existing work faces challenges segmenting visually similar objects in close proximity of each other. In this paper, we propose a novel **Bilateral** Attention Transformer in Motion-Appearance Neighboring space (BATMAN) for semi-supervised VOS. It captures object motion in the video via a novel optical flow calibration module that fuses the segmentation mask with optical flow estimation to improve within-object optical flow smoothness and reduce noise at object boundaries. This calibrated optical flow is then employed in our novel **bilateral** attention, which computes the correspondence between the query and reference frames in the neighboring **bilateral** space considering both motion and appearance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BATMAN architecture by outperforming all existing state-of-the-art on all four popular VOS benchmarks: Youtube-VOS 2019 (85.0%), Youtube-VOS 2018 (85.3%), DAVIS 2017Val/Testdev (86.2%/82.2%), and DAVIS 2016 (92.5%).

### SpecGrad: Diffusion Probabilistic Model based Neural Vocoder with Adaptive Noise Spectral Shaping. (arXiv:2203.16749v2 [eess.AS] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Neural vocoder using denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has been improved by adaptation of the diffusion noise distribution to given acoustic features. In this study, we propose SpecGrad that adapts the diffusion noise so that its time-varying spectral envelope becomes close to the conditioning log-mel spectrogram. This adaptation by time-varying filtering improves the sound quality especially in the high-frequency bands. It is processed in the time-frequency domain to keep the computational cost almost the same as the conventional DDPM-based neural vocoders. Experimental results showed that SpecGrad generates higher-fidelity speech waveform than conventional DDPM-based neural vocoders in both analysis-synthesis and speech **enhancement** scenarios. Audio demos are available at wavegrad.github.io/specgrad/.
