> ABSTRACT  :  Motivated by their recent advances, deep learning techniques have been widely applied to **low-light** image **enhancement** (LIE) problem. Among which, Retinex theory based ones, mostly following a decomposition-adjustment pipeline, have taken an important place due to its physical interpretation and promising performance. However, current investigations on Retinex based deep learning are still not sufficient, ignoring many useful experiences from traditional methods. Besides, the adjustment step is either performed with simple image processing techniques, or by complicated networks, both of which are unsatisfactory in practice. To address these issues, we propose a new deep learning framework for the LIE problem. The proposed framework contains a decomposition network inspired by algorithm unrolling, and adjustment networks considering both global brightness and local brightness sensitivity. By virtue of algorithm unrolling, both implicit priors learned from data and explicit priors borrowed from traditional methods can be embedded in the network, facilitate to better decomposition. Meanwhile, the consideration of global and local brightness can guide designing simple yet effective network modules for adjustment. Besides, to avoid manually parameter tuning, we also propose a self-supervised fine-tuning strategy, which can always guarantee a promising performance. Experiments on a series of typical LIE datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, both quantitatively and visually, as compared with existing methods.

> ABSTRACT  :  Some of the most exciting experiences that Metaverse promises to offer, for instance, live interactions with virtual characters in virtual environments, require real-time photo-realistic rendering. 3D reconstruction approaches to rendering, active or passive, still require extensive cleanup work to fix the meshes or point clouds. In this paper, we present a neural volumography technique called neural volumetric video or NeuVV to support immersive, interactive, and spatial-temporal rendering of volumetric video contents with photo-realism and in real-time. The core of NeuVV is to efficiently encode a dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) into renderable and editable primitives. We introduce two types of factorization schemes: a hyper-spherical harmonics (HH) decomposition for modeling smooth color variations over space and time and a learnable basis representation for modeling abrupt density and color changes caused by motion. NeuVV factorization can be integrated into a Video Octree (VOctree) analogous to PlenOctree to significantly accelerate training while reducing memory overhead. **Real-time** NeuVV rendering further enables a class of immersive content editing tools. Specifically, NeuVV treats each VOctree as a primitive and implements volume-based depth ordering and alpha blending to realize spatial-temporal compositions for content re-purposing. For example, we demonstrate positioning varied manifestations of the same performance at different 3D locations with different timing, adjusting color/texture of the performer's clothing, casting spotlight shadows and synthesizing distance falloff lighting, etc, all at an interactive speed. We further develop a hybrid neural-rasterization rendering framework to support consumer-level VR headsets so that the aforementioned volumetric video viewing and editing, for the first time, can be conducted immersively in virtual 3D space.

> ABSTRACT  :  Recent works have demonstrated that transformer can achieve promising performance in computer vision, by exploiting the relationship among image patches with self-attention. While they only consider the attention in a single feature layer, but ignore the complementarity of attention in different levels. In this paper, we propose the broad attention to improve the performance by incorporating the attention relationship of different layers for vision transformer, which is called BViT. The broad attention is implemented by broad connection and parameter-free attention. Broad connection of each transformer layer promotes the transmission and integration of information for BViT. Without introducing additional trainable parameters, parameter-free attention jointly focuses on the already available attention information in different layers for extracting useful information and building their relationship. Experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that BViT delivers state-of-the-art accuracy of 74.8\%/81.6\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 5M/22M parameters. Moreover, we transfer BViT to downstream object recognition benchmarks to achieve 98.9\% and 89.9\% on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 respectively that exceed ViT with fewer parameters. For the generalization test, the broad attention in **Swin** Transformer and T2T-ViT also bring an improvement of more than 1\%. To sum up, broad attention is promising to promote the performance of attention based models. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/DRL-CASIA/Broad_ViT.  
### Zero-Reference Image **Restoration** for Under-Display Camera of UAV. (arXiv:2202.06283v1 [cs.CV])

> ABSTRACT  :  The exposed cameras of UAV can shake, shift, or even malfunction under the influence of harsh weather, while the add-on devices (Dupont lines) are very vulnerable to damage.    We can place a low-cost T-OLED overlay around the camera to protect it, but this would also introduce image degradation issues.    In particular, the temperature variations in the atmosphere can create mist that adsorbs to the T-OLED, which can cause secondary disasters (i.e., more severe image degradation) during the UAV's filming process.    To solve the image degradation problem caused by overlaying T-OLEDs, in this paper we propose a new method to enhance the visual experience by enhancing the texture and color of images.    Specifically, our method trains a lightweight network to estimate a low-rank affine grid on the input image, and then utilizes the grid to enhance the input image at block granularity.    The advantages of our method are that no reference image is required and the loss function is developed from visual experience.    In addition, our model can perform high-quality recovery of images of arbitrary resolution in **real time**.    In the end, the limitations of our model and the collected datasets (including the daytime and **night**time scenes) are discussed.

> ABSTRACT  :  Previous deep learning-based line segment detection (LSD) suffers from the immense model size and high computational cost for line prediction. This constrains them from real-time inference on computationally restricted environments. In this paper, we propose a real-time and light-weight line segment detector for resource-constrained environments named Mobile LSD (M-LSD). We design an extremely efficient LSD architecture by minimizing the backbone network and removing the typical multi-module process for line prediction found in previous methods. To maintain competitive performance with a light-weight network, we present novel training schemes: Segments of Line segment (SoL) augmentation, matching and geometric loss. SoL augmentation splits a line segment into multiple subparts, which are used to provide auxiliary line data during the training process. Moreover, the matching and geometric loss allow a model to capture additional geometric cues. Compared with TP-LSD-Lite, previously the best real-time LSD method, our model (M-LSD-tiny) achieves competitive performance with 2.5% of model size and an increase of 130.5% in inference speed on GPU. Furthermore, our model runs at 56.8 FPS and 48.6 FPS on the latest Android and iPhone mobile devices, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-time deep LSD available on mobile devices. Our code is available.

> ABSTRACT  :  Adverse weather image translation belongs to the unsupervised image-to-image (I2I) translation task which aims to transfer adverse condition domain (eg, rainy **night**) to standard domain (eg, day). It is a challenging task because images from adverse domains have some artifacts and insufficient information. Recently, many studies employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved notable success in I2I translation but there are still limitations in applying them to adverse weather **enhancement**. Symmetric architecture based on bidirectional cycle-consistency loss is adopted as a standard framework for unsupervised domain transfer methods. However, it can lead to inferior translation result if the two domains have imbalanced information. To address this issue, we propose a novel GAN model, i.e., AU-GAN, which has an asymmetric architecture for adverse domain translation. We insert a proposed feature transfer network (${T}$-net) in only a normal domain generator (i.e., rainy **night**-&gt; day) to enhance encoded features of the adverse domain image. In addition, we introduce asymmetric feature matching for disentanglement of encoded features. Finally, we propose uncertainty-aware cycle-consistency loss to address the regional uncertainty of a cyclic reconstructed image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by qualitative and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art models. Codes are available at https://github.com/jgkwak95/AU-GAN.

> ABSTRACT  :  Phase-Stretch Adaptive Gradient-Field Extractor (PAGE) is an edge detection algorithm that is inspired by physics of electromagnetic diffraction and dispersion. A computational imaging algorithm, it identifies edges, their orientations and sharpness in a digital image where the image brightness changes abruptly. Edge detection is a basic operation performed by the eye and is crucial to visual perception. PAGE embeds an original image into a set of feature maps that can be used for object representation and classification. The algorithm performs exceptionally well as an edge and texture extractor in **low light** level and low contrast images.

> ABSTRACT  :  18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging usually needs a full-dose radioactive tracer to obtain satisfactory diagnostic results, which raises concerns about the potential health risks of radiation **exposure**, especially for pediatric patients. Reconstructing the low-dose PET (L-PET) images to the high-quality full-dose PET (F-PET) ones is an effective way that both reduces the radiation **exposure** and remains diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient deep learning framework for L-PET reconstruction and analysis, referred to as transGAN-SDAM, to generate F-PET from corresponding L-PET, and quantify the standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) of these generated F-PET at whole brain. The transGAN-SDAM consists of two modules: a transformer-encoded Generative Adversarial Network (transGAN) and a Spatial Deformable Aggregation Module (SDAM). The transGAN generates higher quality F-PET images, and then the SDAM integrates the spatial information of a sequence of generated F-PET slices to synthesize whole-brain F-PET images. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority and rationality of our approach.  
### Domain Decomposition Algorithms for **Real-time** Homogeneous Diffusion Inpainting in 4K. (arXiv:2110.03946v3 [eess.IV] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Inpainting-based compression methods are qualitatively promising alternatives to transform-based codecs, but they suffer from the high computational cost of the inpainting step. This prevents them from being applicable to time-critical scenarios such as real-time inpainting of 4K images. As a remedy, we adapt state-of-the-art numerical algorithms of domain decomposition type to this problem. They decompose the image domain into multiple overlapping blocks that can be inpainted in parallel by means of modern GPUs. In contrast to classical block decompositions such as the ones in JPEG, the global inpainting problem is solved without creating block artefacts. We consider the popular homogeneous diffusion inpainting and supplement it with a multilevel version of an optimised restricted additive Schwarz (ORAS) method that solves the local problems with a conjugate gradient algorithm. This enables us to perform real-time inpainting of 4K colour images on contemporary GPUs, which is substantially more efficient than previous algorithms for diffusion-based inpainting.

### Improving Image-recognition Edge Caches with a Generative Adversarial Network. (arXiv:2202.05929v1 [cs.NI])
- Authors : 
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05929](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05929)
> ABSTRACT  :  Image recognition is an essential task in several mobile applications. For instance, a smartphone can process a landmark photo to gather more information about its location. If the device does not have enough computational resources available, it offloads the processing task to a cloud infrastructure. Although this approach solves resource shortages, it introduces a communication delay. Image-recognition caches on the Internet's edge can mitigate this problem. These caches run on servers close to mobile devices and stores information about previously recognized images. If the server receives a request with a photo stored in its cache, it replies to the device, avoiding cloud offloading. The main challenge for this cache is to verify if the received image matches a stored one. Furthermore, for outdoor photos, it is difficult to compare them if one was taken in the daytime and the other at **night**time. In that case, the cache might wrongly infer that they refer to different places, offloading the processing to the cloud. This work shows that a well-known generative adversarial network, called ToDayGAN, can solve this problem by generating daytime images using **night**time ones. We can thus use this translation to populate a cache with synthetic photos that can help image matching. We show that our solution reduces cloud offloading and, therefore, the application's latency.  
### Automatic Issue Classifier: A Transfer Learning Framework for Classifying Issue Reports. (arXiv:2202.06149v1 [cs.SE])

> ABSTRACT  :  Issue tracking systems are used in the software industry for the facilitation of maintenance activities that keep the software robust and up to date with ever-changing industry requirements. Usually, users report issues that can be categorized into different labels such as bug reports, **enhancement** requests, and questions related to the software. Most of the issue tracking systems make the labelling of these issue reports optional for the issue submitter, which leads to a large number of unlabeled issue reports. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art method to classify the issue reports into their respective categories i.e. bug, **enhancement**, and question. This is a challenging task because of the common use of informal language in the issue reports. Existing studies use traditional natural language processing approaches adopting key-word based features, which fail to incorporate the contextual relationship between words and therefore result in a high rate of false positives and false negatives. Moreover, previous works utilize a uni-label approach to classify the issue reports however, in reality, an issue-submitter can tag one issue report with more than one label at a time. This paper presents our approach to classify the issue reports in a multi-label setting. We use an off-the-shelf neural network called RoBERTa and fine-tune it to classify the issue reports. We validate our approach on issue reports belonging to numerous industrial projects from GitHub. We were able to achieve promising F-1 scores of 81%, 74%, and 80% for bug reports, **enhancement**s, and questions, respectively. We also develop an industry tool called Automatic Issue Classifier (AIC), which automatically assigns labels to newly reported issues on GitHub repositories with high accuracy.  
### Beyond NaN: Resiliency of Optimization Layers in The Face of Infeasibility. (arXiv:2202.06242v1 [cs.LG])

> ABSTRACT  :  Prior work has successfully incorporated optimization layers as the last layer in neural networks for various problems, thereby allowing joint learning and planning in one neural network forward pass. In this work, we identify a weakness in such a set-up where inputs to the optimization layer lead to undefined output of the neural network. Such undefined decision outputs can lead to possible catastrophic outcomes in critical **real time** applications. We show that an adversary can cause such failures by forcing rank deficiency on the matrix fed to the optimization layer which results in the optimization failing to produce a solution. We provide a defense for the failure cases by controlling the condition number of the input matrix. We study the problem in the settings of synthetic data, Jigsaw Sudoku, and in speed planning for autonomous driving, building on top of prior frameworks in end-to-end learning and optimization. We show that our proposed defense effectively prevents the framework from failing with undefined output. Finally, we surface a number of edge cases which lead to serious bugs in popular equation and optimization solvers which can be abused as well.

### Smart and Secure CAV Networks Empowered by AI-Enabled Blockchain: The Next Frontier for Intelligent Safe Driving Assessment. (arXiv:2104.04572v5 [cs.NI] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Securing safe driving for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) continues to be a widespread concern, despite various sophisticated functions delivered by artificial intelligence for in-vehicle devices. Diverse malicious network attacks are ubiquitous, along with the worldwide implementation of the Internet of Vehicles, which exposes a range of reliability and privacy threats for managing data in CAV networks. Combined with the fact that the capability of existing CAVs in handling intensive computation tasks is limited, this implies a need for designing an efficient assessment system to guarantee autonomous driving safety without compromising data security. In this article we propose a novel framework, namely Blockchain-enabled intElligent Safe-driving assessmenT (BEST), which offers a smart and reliable approach for conducting safe driving supervision while protecting vehicular information. Specifically, a promising solution that exploits a long short-term memory model is introduced to assess the safety level of the moving CAVs. Then we investigate how a distributed blockchain obtains adequate trustworthiness and robustness for CAV data by adopting a byzantine fault tolerance-based delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Simulation results demonstrate that our presented BEST gains better data credibility with a higher prediction accuracy for vehicular safety assessment when compared with existing schemes. Finally, we discuss several open challenges that need to be addressed in future CAV networks.  
### Dual-branch Attention-In-Attention Transformer for single-channel speech **enhancement**. (arXiv:2110.06467v5 [cs.SD] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  Curriculum learning begins to thrive in the speech **enhancement** area, which decouples the original spectrum estimation task into multiple easier sub-tasks to achieve better performance. Motivated by that, we propose a dual-branch attention-in-attention transformer dubbed DB-AIAT to handle both coarse- and fine-grained regions of the spectrum in parallel. From a complementary perspective, a magnitude masking branch is proposed to coarsely estimate the overall magnitude spectrum, and simultaneously a complex refining branch is elaborately designed to compensate for the missing spectral details and implicitly derive phase information. Within each branch, we propose a novel attention-in-attention transformer-based module to replace the conventional RNNs and temporal convolutional networks for temporal sequence modeling. Specifically, the proposed attention-in-attention transformer consists of adaptive temporal-frequency attention transformer blocks and an adaptive hierarchical attention module, aiming to capture long-term temporal-frequency dependencies and further aggregate global hierarchical contextual information. Experimental results on Voice Bank + DEMAND demonstrate that DB-AIAT yields state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 3.31 PESQ, 95.6% STOI and 10.79dB SSNR) over previous advanced systems with a relatively small model size (2.81M).

> ABSTRACT  :  Soft sensors have continued growing interest in robotics, due to their ability to enable both passive conformal contact from the material properties and active contact data from the sensor properties. However, the same properties of conformal contact result in faster deterioration of soft sensors and larger variations in their response characteristics over time and across samples, inhibiting their ability to be long-lasting and replaceable. ReSkin is a tactile soft sensor that leverages machine learning and magnetic sensing to offer a low-cost, diverse and compact solution for long-term use. Magnetic sensing separates the electronic circuitry from the passive interface, making it easier to replace interfaces as they wear out while allowing for a wide variety of form factors. Machine learning allows us to learn sensor response models that are robust to variations across fabrication and time, and our self-supervised learning algorithm enables finer performance **enhancement** with small, inexpensive data collection procedures. We believe that ReSkin opens the door to more versatile, scalable and inexpensive tactile sensation modules than existing alternatives.
