> ABSTRACT  :  Recent work done on traffic sign and traffic light detection focus on improving detection accuracy in complex scenarios, yet many fail to deliver real-time performance, specifically with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a simple deep learning based end-to-end detection framework, which effectively tackles challenges inherent to traffic sign and traffic light detection such as small size, large number of classes and complex road scenarios. We optimize the detection models using TensorRT and integrate with Robot Operating System to deploy on an Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier as our embedded device. The overall system achieves a high inference speed of 63 frames per second, demonstrating the capability of our system to perform in real-time. Furthermore, we introduce CeyRo, which is the first ever large-scale traffic sign and traffic light detection dataset for the Sri Lankan context. Our dataset consists of 7984 total images with 10176 traffic sign and traffic light instances covering 70 traffic sign and 5 traffic light classes. The images have a high resolution of 1920 x 1080 and capture a wide range of challenging road scenarios with different weather and lighting conditions. Our work is publicly available at https://github.com/oshadajay/CeyRo.

> ABSTRACT  :  **Real-time** in-between motion generation is universally required in games and highly desirable in existing animation pipelines. Its core challenge lies in the need to satisfy three critical conditions simultaneously: quality, controllability and speed, which renders any methods that need offline computation (or post-processing) or cannot incorporate (often unpredictable) user control undesirable. To this end, we propose a new real-time transition method to address the aforementioned challenges. Our approach consists of two key components: motion manifold and conditional transitioning. The former learns the important low-level motion features and their dynamics; while the latter synthesizes transitions conditioned on a target frame and the desired transition duration. We first learn a motion manifold that explicitly models the intrinsic transition stochasticity in human motions via a multi-modal mapping mechanism. Then, during generation, we design a transition model which is essentially a sampling strategy to sample from the learned manifold, based on the target frame and the aimed transition duration. We validate our method on different datasets in tasks where no post-processing or offline computation is allowed. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we show that our method is able to generate high-quality motions measured under multiple metrics. Our method is also robust under various target frames (with extreme cases).

> ABSTRACT  :  This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing 3D indoor scenes from multi-view images. Many previous works have shown impressive reconstruction results on textured objects, but they still have difficulty in handling low-textured planar regions, which are common in indoor scenes. An approach to solving this issue is to incorporate planer constraints into the depth map estimation in multi-view stereo-based methods, but the per-view plane estimation and depth optimization lack both efficiency and multi-view consistency. In this work, we show that the planar constraints can be conveniently integrated into the recent **implicit neural representation**-based reconstruction methods. Specifically, we use an MLP network to represent the signed distance function as the scene geometry. Based on the Manhattan-world assumption, planar constraints are employed to regularize the geometry in floor and wall regions predicted by a 2D semantic segmentation network. To resolve the inaccurate segmentation, we encode the semantics of 3D points with another MLP and design a novel loss that jointly optimizes the scene geometry and semantics in 3D space. Experiments on ScanNet and 7-Scenes datasets show that the proposed method outperforms previous methods by a large margin on 3D reconstruction quality. The code is available at https://zju3dv.github.io/manhattan_sdf.  
### Smooth-Swap: A Simple **Enhancement** for Face-Swapping with Smoothness. (arXiv:2112.05907v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)
- Authors : Jiseob Kim, Jihoon Lee, Tak Zhang
- Link : [http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05907](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05907)
> ABSTRACT  :  Face-swapping models have been drawing attention for their compelling generation quality, but their complex architectures and loss functions often require careful tuning for successful training. We propose a new face-swapping model called `Smooth-Swap', which excludes complex handcrafted designs and allows fast and stable training. The main idea of Smooth-Swap is to build smooth identity embedding that can provide stable gradients for identity change. Unlike the one used in previous models trained for a purely discriminative task, the proposed embedding is trained with a supervised contrastive loss promoting a smoother space. With improved smoothness, Smooth-Swap suffices to be composed of a generic U-Net-based generator and three basic loss functions, a far simpler design compared with the previous models. Extensive experiments on face-swapping benchmarks (FFHQ, FaceForensics++) and face images in the wild show that our model is also quantitatively and qualitatively comparable or even superior to the existing methods.

### Multi-Graph based Multi-Scenario Recommendation in Large-scale Online Video Services. (arXiv:2205.02446v1 [cs.AI])
- Authors : Fan Zhang, Qiuying Peng, Yulin Wu, Zheng Pan, Rong Zeng, Da Lin, Yue Qi

> ABSTRACT  :  Recently, industrial recommendation services have been boosted by the continual upgrade of deep learning methods. However, they still face de-biasing challenges such as **exposure** bias and cold-start problem, where circulations of machine learning training on human interaction history leads algorithms to repeatedly suggest exposed items while ignoring less-active ones. Additional problems exist in multi-scenario platforms, e.g. appropriate data fusion from subsidiary scenarios, which we observe could be alleviated through graph structured data integration via message passing.    In this paper, we present a multi-graph structured multi-scenario recommendation solution, which encapsulates interaction data across scenarios with multi-graph and obtains representation via graph learning. Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets are conducted where the proposed method demonstrates an increase of 0.63% and 0.71% in CTR and Video Views per capita on new users over deployed set of baselines and outperforms regular method in increasing the number of outer-scenario videos by 25% and video watches by 116%, validating its superiority in activating cold videos and enriching target recommendation.

> ABSTRACT  :  Cryptocurrencies are no longer just the preferred option for cybercriminal activities on **dark**nets, due to the increasing adoption in mainstream applications. This is partly due to the transparency associated with the underpinning ledgers, where any individual can access the record of a transaction record on the public ledger. In this paper, we build a dataset comprising Bitcoin transactions between 12 July 2019 and 26 May 2021. This dataset (hereafter referred to as BABD-13) contains 13 types of Bitcoin addresses, 5 categories of indicators with 148 features, and 544,462 labeled data, which is the largest labeled Bitcoin address behavior dataset publicly available to our knowledge. We then use our proposed dataset on common machine learning models, namely: k-nearest neighbors algorithm, decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and XGBoost. The results show that the accuracy rates of these machine learning models for the multi-classification task on our proposed dataset are between 93.24% and 97.13%. We also analyze the proposed features and their relationships from the experiments, and propose a k-hop subgraph generation algorithm to extract a k-hop subgraph from the entire Bitcoin transaction graph constructed by the directed heterogeneous multigraph starting from a specific Bitcoin address node (e.g., a known transaction associated with a criminal investigation). Besides, we initially analyze the behavior patterns of different types of Bitcoin addresses according to the extracted features.

> ABSTRACT  :  Active inference is an account of cognition and behavior in complex systems which brings together action, perception, and learning under the theoretical mantle of Bayesian inference. Active inference has seen growing applications in academic research, especially in fields that seek to model human or animal behavior. While in recent years, some of the code arising from the active inference literature has been written in open source languages like Python and Julia, to-date, the most popular software for simulating active inference agents is the DEM toolbox of SPM, a MATLAB library originally developed for the statistical analysis and modelling of neuroimaging data. Increasing interest in active inference, manifested both in terms of sheer number as well as diversifying applications across scientific disciplines, has thus created a need for generic, widely-available, and user-friendly code for simulating active inference in open-source scientific computing languages like Python. The Python package we present here, pymdp (see https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp), represents a significant step in this direction: namely, we provide the first open-source package for simulating active inference with partially-observable Markov Decision Processes or POMDPs. We review the package's structure and explain its advantages like modular design and customizability, while providing in-text code blocks along the way to demonstrate how it can be used to build and run active inference processes with ease. We developed pymdp to increase the accessibility and **exposure** of the active inference framework to researchers, engineers, and developers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. In the spirit of open-source software, we also hope that it spurs new innovation, development, and collaboration in the growing active inference community.  
### Enhance Incomplete Utterance **Restoration** by Joint Learning Token Extraction and Text Generation. (arXiv:2204.03958v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)

> ABSTRACT  :  This paper introduces a model for incomplete utterance **restoration** (IUR). Different from prior studies that only work on extraction or abstraction datasets, we design a simple but effective model, working for both scenarios of IUR. Our design simulates the nature of IUR, where omitted tokens from the context contribute to **restoration**. From this, we construct a Picker that identifies the omitted tokens. To support the picker, we design two label creation methods (soft and hard labels), which can work in cases of no annotation of the omitted tokens. The **restoration** is done by using a Generator with the help of the Picker on joint learning. Promising results on four benchmark datasets in extraction and abstraction scenarios show that our model is better than the pretrained T5 and non-generative language model methods in both rich and limited training data settings. The code will be also available (https://github.com/shumpei19/jointiur).
