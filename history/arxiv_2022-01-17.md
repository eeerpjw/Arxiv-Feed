> ABSTRACT  :  In this paper, a straightforward **enhancement** learning algorithm based on Separation Index (SI) concept is proposed for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). At first, the SI as a supervised complexity measure is explained its usage in better learning of CNNs for classification problems illustrate. Then, a learning strategy proposes through which the first layer of a CNN is optimized by maximizing the SI, and the further layers are trained through the backpropagation algorithm to learn further layers. In order to maximize the SI at the first layer, A variant of ranking loss is optimized by using the quasi least square error technique. Applying such a learning strategy to some known CNNs and datasets, its **enhancement** impact in almost all cases is demonstrated.

> ABSTRACT  :  Activity detection is one of the attractive computer vision tasks to exploit the video streams captured by widely installed cameras. Although achieving impressive performance, conventional activity detection algorithms are usually designed under certain constraints, such as using trimmed and/or object-centered video clips as inputs. Therefore, they failed to deal with the multi-scale multi-instance cases in real-world unconstrained video streams, which are untrimmed and have large field-of-views. **Real-time** requirements for streaming analysis also mark brute force expansion of them unfeasible.    To overcome these issues, we propose Argus++, a robust real-time activity detection system for analyzing unconstrained video streams. The design of Argus++ introduces overlapping spatio-temporal cubes as an intermediate concept of activity proposals to ensure coverage and completeness of activity detection through over-sampling. The overall system is optimized for real-time processing on standalone consumer-level hardware. Extensive experiments on different surveillance and driving scenarios demonstrated its superior performance in a series of activity detection benchmarks, including CVPR ActivityNet ActEV 2021, NIST ActEV SDL UF/KF, TRECVID ActEV 2020/2021, and ICCV ROAD 2021.

### Adaptive Deep PnP Algorithm for Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging. (arXiv:2201.05483v1 [eess.IV])

> ABSTRACT  :  Video Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) is a promising technique to capture high-speed videos, which transforms the imaging speed from the detector to mask modulating and only needs a single measurement to capture multiple frames. The algorithm to reconstruct high-speed frames from the measurement plays a vital role in SCI. In this paper, we consider the promising reconstruction algorithm framework, namely plug-and-play (PnP), which is flexible to the encoding process comparing with other deep learning networks. One drawback of existing PnP algorithms is that they use a pre-trained denoising network as a plugged prior while the training data of the network might be different from the task in real applications. Towards this end, in this work, we propose the online PnP algorithm which can adaptively update the network's parameters within the PnP iteration; this makes the denoising network more applicable to the desired data in the SCI reconstruction. Furthermore, for color video imaging, RGB frames need to be recovered from Bayer pattern or named demosaicing in the **camera pipeline**.To address this challenge, we design a two-stage reconstruction framework to optimize these two coupled ill-posed problems and introduce a deep demosaicing prior specifically for video demosaicing. Extensive results on both simulation and real datasets verify the superiority of our adaptive deep PnP algorithm.

### Probabilistic Mass Mapping with Neural Score Estimation. (arXiv:2201.05561v1 [astro-ph.CO])

> ABSTRACT  :  Weak lensing mass-mapping is a useful tool to access the full distribution of **dark** matter on the sky, but because of intrinsic galaxy ellipticies and finite fields/missing data, the recovery of **dark** matter maps constitutes a challenging ill-posed inverse problem. We introduce a novel methodology allowing for efficient sampling of the high-dimensional Bayesian posterior of the weak lensing mass-mapping problem, and relying on simulations for defining a fully non-Gaussian prior. We aim to demonstrate the accuracy of the method on simulations, and then proceed to applying it to the mass reconstruction of the HST/ACS COSMOS field. The proposed methodology combines elements of Bayesian statistics, analytic theory, and a recent class of Deep Generative Models based on Neural Score Matching. This approach allows us to do the following: 1) Make full use of analytic cosmological theory to constrain the 2pt statistics of the solution. 2) Learn from cosmological simulations any differences between this analytic prior and full simulations. 3) Obtain samples from the full Bayesian posterior of the problem for robust Uncertainty Quantification. We demonstrate the method on the $\kappa$TNG simulations and find that the posterior mean significantly outperfoms previous methods (Kaiser-Squires, Wiener filter, Sparsity priors) both on root-mean-square error and in terms of the Pearson correlation. We further illustrate the interpretability of the recovered posterior by establishing a close correlation between posterior convergence values and SNR of clusters artificially introduced into a field. Finally, we apply the method to the reconstruction of the HST/ACS COSMOS field and yield the highest quality convergence map of this field to date.
